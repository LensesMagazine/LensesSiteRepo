                <p class="u-text u-text-body-alt-color u-text-6">The cruelness of lethargy or indolence<br><br>A man was cast into a horrible punishment after he was caught disobeying a god’s decree and dressing<br>too extravagantly.<br><br>Ivo: trapped in a glossy cage is oppressively pressed against a cold prideful glass. he is in a stretched and<br>exposed position, his chest is bare and exposed to the world, his primped breath produces a thick layer<br>of condensation that obscures his vision. In this state Ivo is so genuine no leper or fool can mistake<br>themselves as to not notice the gentle raising movement that his breathing causes, his heart gently<br>beats. In this state Ivo exists trapped inside a glass cage, the glass runs ambiguously tall and gives<br>enough room for some movement, its tip is rounded off as to make the glass cage describable as a<br>cylindrical object with a semi-sphere crown. the glass boundary is full of large pieces of paper with<br>written messages on them. An obscured figure enters the scene, and stands to Ivo’s side, isolated from<br>Ivo’s presence, just behind the glass.<br>Ivo, with his iniquitous locks of classical hair and his single pierced right ear, gently flings his abdomen<br>around slitting it gently against the edges of the paper stacked in his environment in order to assume a<br>humbler pose. this movement also aided Ivo in avoiding the buildup of condensation against the glass.<br>His earing is a tear shaped emerald that hangs from a gold chain. It all serves to catch the attention of a<br>young man pondering Ivo.<br>It was after Ivo’s jerked movement, that Ivo could clearly see the now clearly defined figure. Ivo’s eyes,<br>glistening and honest, glance at the figures shoes: they were black and nicely fit, Ivo’s glance ricochets<br>against the young man’s outfit: simple and dark, unbearably uniform-like; and in one swift movement,<br>Ivo peeks at the young man’s face where he notes the man’s conventional yet handsome appearance,<br>his clear and fair skin, his nicely trimmed hair and his piercing unmoving eyes; aided by his apathetic<br>facial expression.<br>Ivo, stuck in his cage feels an unbearable weight on his heart, as if the pride of a million resting lions was<br>gently set on him, by an unaffected hand. Him, as atlas, as the representative of order and sacrifice<br>quickly glances back up at the young man who is watching him, he attempts to communicate with the<br>quiet figure.<br><br>IVO: why do you glance at my bare body with no such grace? No moron or fool is “brave” enough to<br>decry the vanity of others.<br>*Ivo stays still and allows a small amount of time for the young man to respond.<br>*Ivo attempts to signal to the young man who is patiently watching him and analyzing his locks of hair<br>and his pitiful situation, with a slight raise of his eyebrow.<br>IVO: well?...<br><br>Ivo in an uncomfortable position, stares at the young man as he patiently watches him; considering the<br>fleeting time spent in the last few moments. the young man turns his head sideways and begins to<br>stumble away, the first two steps are stepped backwards and still facing Ivo, the young man stops<br>himself immediately, turns, facing the glass container while ignoring Ivo and begins walking away past<br>the glass as he scoffs.<br>When Ivo watched that unmoved young man begins to walk away he felt an anxious urge to push<br>through the glass and grasp at his legs and beg him for acknowledgement, upon the realization of his<br>boundaries, he diverted his attention to his paper filled vessel and peered at the silver-like sharp paper.<br>as Ivo thought to himself and visualized the leap to the other side of the container, he acknowledged the<br>pain in watching the young man leave and the pain of the paper cuts. He then closes his eyes delicately<br>and bravely tosses himself through the paper marking it velvety and crisp, he then gently lays at the<br>other side pressing his body up at the glass, seeking some comfort, he re-adjusts and finally feels<br>comfortable; this ‘comfort’ laid way for a buildup of condensation to form. Oppressively: the thick<br>condensation settles in such a way that turns the young man into a vague figure. Ivo aguishly slides<br>down against the glass while also flipping over and is finally able to read one of the notes “don’t let the<br>Perrier get to your head”; a sudden realization sets in: Ivo’s eyes widen, until the moment is interrupted<br>by the sound of steps. Ivo can barely make out that they’re growing louder.<br>Ivo’s fate was sealed for him before he ever knew what he was.
