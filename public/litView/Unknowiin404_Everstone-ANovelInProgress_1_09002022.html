                  <div style="color: white; font-size: 110%; text-align: left; line-height: 190%;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Try to think of a world where all you could think of are bombs. Just the sound of them going off at almost every minute would obviously make one traumatized until they die, right? That’s how I felt when I watched my mother die in my arms, her weak smile and plump lips covered in dry blood moving as she spoke her last words. Though from mine, nothing but begging came out. “Oh darling, I’m going to miss you too. Like.. A lot, a lot. But I’ll always be with you. Even when..” Her eyes glossed over as she tilted her head to the side, staring at only the vast grey-blue sky that was polluted with gas. I opened my mouth to scream but my ears were still ringing from the incident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  My mother was known as the sweetest woman anyone in the neighborhood had met. She had the eyes of an angel, her hair moving in the wind as a waterfall would in a valley. Though the dishes she made, tasted like the gateways of heaven itself. If you’d ask my stomach, her food was to die for. There was nothing like the smile that shined off of her face every time she gazed at something interesting. But that’s coming from me, as her son. If I had remembered correctly, she had asked me to help her with her famous fruitcake, and I had promised to bring her the ingredients she needed. Next thing I knew, she was bleeding from her torso–a glass shard impaling her.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  I hadn’t noticed my father until I tripped over him, my shoes covered in the familiar crimson that I would see in horror movies. If my father had known that, I wouldn’t be alive as of right now. Luckily for me, he didn’t, but instead lay motionless on the ground near the stairwell. A large piece of concrete crushing his airway, guts on display. His death, unlike my mother's, hadn't affected me. If anything, all I wanted for that man was to die so that my mother could find another man who’d actually care for their child even though they had a physical disability. Ever since I opened my eyes, my father had pure hatred for me. All he did in my life was to put it to misery, and would praise my brother instead. Even for the slightest unimportant action that he did, my father would adore him as if he were an egyptian praising their god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  Similar to my mother, my brother admired my physical condition. They both did. And each time my father mentioned them, that kid would start talking about how cool they looked. “Did you know they shined in the dark? They’re like flashlights! Only with color!” He’d chirp happily. Silence would replace my brother’s appraisal, and my father would take him upstairs by the arm. Though the house would usually be filled with the yells of my mother towards my father, that night they were filled with higher-pitched screams. And that woman would’ve done nothing but stare at the blank screen of our television. A single tear drop would always be rolling down her right cheek. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  As mentioned earlier, I had gone to pick up the ingredients that my mother needed for her fruitcake. My brother had been outside, and gently asked if he could come, but I strongly urged him not to. He nodded his head, and hurried back to his game of beetle flipping. Fortunately, I hadn’t gone by myself.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  ~*~<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  “Your mom asked you for what?” A boy of about my age blinked confusedly as I handed him the list that my mother gave me. “She’s making fruitcake! I just happened to run into her and she asked me for help.” A smile ran across my freckled face as the other let out a laugh. “Fruitcake? Isn’t that something that humans eat in… Krismaths?” Laughter filled the air as I explained to my best friend, Mason, once more of the traditions that Terrans had.   <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  Mason was a kid who was always by my side. Ever since grade school, he complimented my eyes and beat up anyone who thought otherwise. I used to remind him that he’d get in trouble, but as I watched with my own two heterochromatic eyes, Mason always got away with it and flew away. That or he hid in the shadows. He’d brush his charcoal-colored bangs from his eyes and say, “It’s cool, we’re all cool, everything’s totally fine.” ‘No it’s not!’ I’d yell in my head, but I knew that he’d be fine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  It was also Mason who knew that something was terribly wrong today. He’d give me the most horrified look that I've ever seen him make, those golden irises glistening in the sunset. “You alri–” He cut me off with a tightening hug, digging his head into the crook of my neck. “You need to go. We both do.” Mason’s voice broke, the boy breathing heavily into my shoulder. A few birds in the distance squealed in panic as the wind grew more violently. “Why? Mason, what’s going on?” That was when he took my hand and placed something in it, not giving me any time to respond. “I was meaning to give you this when we go to separate schools but.. I guess not.” Mason let out a weak chuckle, his signature smile turning into a frown as he noticed a tear roll down my cheek. As he lifted his hand to rub it away with his thumb, I received a warm sensation–a flashback. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  A group of girls were whispering about my eyes, and I had just sat down outside for lunch. My mother would always pack my food, however I would never sit with the other kids. To my misfortune, those girls found me and decided to start off my first day of school with a bad reputation in my mind. Just as their “leader” was about to start talking, a black blur appeared out of nowhere, and cries filled the air. A pencil, dug deep into one of the girls’ legs was revealed, and was my first sight of blood. She managed to get up and fly away, crying that one day she’ll have her revenge. But to my satisfaction, I knew that would never happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  Attention was turned to my hero who had just saved me from a possible traumatic experience, but he didn’t let me say my first words towards him. He spoke, and I listened quietly. “Tada! Liked my trick? It was pretty great, I know. I’ve seen a bunch of movies and all of those guys just don’t do it right. So, I did it my way. The best way.” My future best friend extended his arm towards me, and something felt jittery inside me. “Name’s Mason by the way. What’s yours?” I responded with my name, and thanked him. Soon, I got the urge to ask as to why he’d done that, and Mason opened his mouth to speak once more. “I mean, why would anyone talk about your eyes like that? They’re cool!” He crossed his arms as he huffed, his wings moving in sync with him as he expressed whatever he felt. My lips parted as I couldn’t think of anything else to say. Being young and everything, all I could do was repeat, “My eyes are.. Cool?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  “Uhuh?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  “You.. like them?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  “Uhuh.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  As a tear rolled down my cheek involuntarily, Mason’s eyes widened as he silently panicked. He leaned forward and rubbed it away with his thumb, our eyes locking. I was caught out of my trance as I saw him do it again, Mason wrapping his arms around me for one last hug. This time however, his wings were included. After we parted, we promised that after what was about to happen, we would reunite and forever stay together. He told me something important, but I couldn’t hear anything. My ears had begun to ring intensely. I grabbed a red pen from my pocket and quickly drew the both of us on the list, writing a note before we ran in separate directions. My mother was at the doorstep and I leapt into her arms, a bomb going off as I was mid-air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  Everything started to collapse and the next thing I knew, I was standing in a pile of blood, the red-black bracelet around my wrist.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  ~*~<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  I strode about the streets, trying to find survivors. Fortunately there were a few, some missing a limb or two, others in perfect shape. The amount of bodies that I found weren’t surprising, on the other hand. As I passed house by house, my hope for finding Mason sunk, and my visions for a happier life began to shatter. I finally found his; similar to mine, it was all crumbled to pieces. I panicked when I saw the bodies, though I had recognized it to be only his father. To my dismay, Mason and his sister were both missing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  My courage for the future was dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  A booming laughter broke the silence, a dark figure of a large machine appeared in the distance surrounded by the dust particles in the air. People let out hushed gasps of fear, those families who survived already beginning to evacuate. I stood with the last of my will to live in hand, walking over to the middle of the street. One soldier appeared, gun under his arm and ready to fire. Then came another, followed by a few more. At this point, people began to run away–which was when the shooting began. But they weren’t shooting at random. Those who demonstrated fear and attempted to run away were shot down. Knowing what Mason would do, I held my ground and stared at the small figure on top of the large tank that was now visible through the fog.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  The man wore a gas mask, for the air smelled like gasoline. Dust particles were thick enough to see, and the sunlight only shined through a hole in a cloud. I suddenly got the urge to fly above it all, to see the grey-blue sky once more. But with only one wing, there was nothing I could do. The figure on the tank grew more visible by the minute, and so did my anger. I had no clue as to where this feeling of wrath had come from. The last time I had once felt anger at this level was the moment my father lashed out on my mother.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  He’s never hit anyone else other than me–though I was a child when he did so, but he had enough of the woman standing up for me that he simply let it all out on her. Grabbing her by all of the hair strands that were stuck to her scalp, he dragged her across the floor and into the air. Once he landed onto the second floor, the door was shut and screams were heard. My brother was only five at the time. I had just turned eight. There was a sound of glass breaking, I figured it was the window. But when it was heard again, my hand folded into a fist. I extended my wings and flew up to the second level of the house, the urge to hurt blinding my vision. Apparently the same thing happened to my father. But it was different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  My mother described it as something she had never seen in her life. She complimented that it was one of the unique things about me. I worried that I would probably use it to harm others in the future. But she instead told me that the chances of that happening were low, for she knew that nothing would enrage me as much as it had that day. What she saw was unearthly, however. The scleras of my eyes turned pitch black, a red crimson hue going off of my hands. Its temperature felt close to that of the surface of the sun, my mother exclaimed. There was a larger figure behind me as well, enveloped in violet. If I took another step, I would’ve lit them both up in flames. But my mother said that the figure had wings unlike mine. One was leather black, the other a navy-blue. My voice was distorted as I yelled at them to stop, and obviously my father had halted his actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  As of right now, that same feeling came back. But I hadn’t felt a spark flowing through my veins as I did that day. All I felt was wrath, and the urge for revenge. “Now look what we have here, gentlemen! ‘Lil Johnny boy wants to start a fight ‘cuz wee old Momma and Poppa are dead! Oh boo hoo!” The voice mocked me, my anger increasing. “WAS ALL OF THIS YOU? HUH? DID YOU DO THIS?” I screamed at the top of my lungs, and surprisingly I heard it for the first time. It was similar to that of a lion’s roar, only it wasn’t a roar of defense, but one to indicate that a hunt was going to start. “Oooh! Feisty, aren’t we? Let’s say I did do that, what would you do, eh? Lunge at me? Chew my head clean off like the dog you are?” The figure leaped from the tank, onto the ground. The sight sickened me, and I wanted to do exactly as he said.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  It was a kid, probably no older than fourteen. He already had a bit of muscle developed, a sleeveless leather jacket over his top. The boy had a horn in the smack center of his forehead, making him appear like a mythical creature. None that I've seen on television, anyway. His hair, though.. It was split into two colors: navy blue and red velvet. No one in the neighborhood had hair such as that, I knew that I wasn’t the only one with two distinct colorful features. “Well?! I’m waiting!” He sang, crossing his arms. I almost jumped at him, but at the sight of the soldiers and what they had done to the escapists, I couldn’t. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  I tried to relax as my mother had taught me, focusing on my breathing. Standing right there was the murderer of my mother, and I wanted to tear his head off completely. “What’s your name?” I managed to call out, the question surprising him. “I didn’t ask for chit-chat, wise guy! And that’s classified information that your idiotic little brain couldn’t possibly handle. You just lost your parents, you should very much want to kill me right now!” He let out a loud laugh, scratching at the circular mark at his cheek. “I ASKED you a QUESTION!” I screamed once more, stomping the ground as hard as I could. As it scared the others as it did to me, the ground cracked beneath us, a large jagged line extending as far as the eye could see. I hadn’t even noticed that the eye phenomenon from that day had occurred again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  The split-haired boy had noticed this, too. “Tell ‘ya what, kid, how ‘bout you come work with us? Since you got that spunk ‘n those badass lookin’ eyes!” I paused. Badass…? A smirk slipped onto his face as he saw my reaction shift to the mention of my eyes. “Oh, but that’s not what others think now, do they? Maybe the term I should’ve used was.. monstrous?” My rage came back. It was as clear as daylight. The guy wanted to be enemies with me, destroy more of me until I begged him to stop. That I’ll join and he’d use me. “How come you’re using a word that’s already claimed by you?” I crossed my arms, furrowing my brows as I glared at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  A small smirk formed on my face as his own turned into a frown. “Nice try, kid. Ya almost had me there.” He chuckled, tilting his head to his soldiers. “But c’mon, why don’t you take that nice sass of yours and bring it to–” I quickly grabbed a nearby glass shard, throwing it at the other’s throat, cutting its side and spilling fresh blood onto his jacket. “Thanks, but no thanks. I wouldn’t want Mother Dearest finding out that I’m working with her killer.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  The boy let out a growl as he stomped his foot on the ground in anger and distress. As I heard him yell at his soldiers to fire at me, I dashed for the forest, swinging on branches and vines as I used the little hovering that my remaining wing could give me.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  ~*~<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  The tears kept on rolling down my cheeks as I watched Mason give his final words before we departed, but this time the ringing stopped. My heart fluttered as I finally heard what he told me. “Listen, we’re only thirteen. We have a whole step ahead of us if we manage to find each other.” He placed his hand on top of the one that held the bracelet he had handed me, “I don’t ever want to see you cry, alright?” I nodded my head, teardrops still falling from my eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  Mason chuckled as he continued to wipe them away, tilting my head up to look at him. “I turn fourteen in two months~” He sang, making me laugh as Mason bragged about his age like always. Our giggles died down as the wind became more furious. I now felt two hands holding my face, our eyes locked together. “Keep on smiling for me, ‘kay?” I nodded my head as tears pooled onto my eyelids again. “I can’t hear you.” A smile slipped onto my face as I opened my mouth to speak.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  “Mkay.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  “Louder.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  “Okay!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  “Alright!” Mason quickly wiped the newly formed tears with my own sleeve, patting my cheek with his hand. Before he turned to leave, I hesitated to ask. “We’ll find each other after this, right?” Mason turned back towards me, smiling. “Yeah.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  “Do you promise?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  ~*~<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  I sat in the leather chair that I found while scurrying back to the scene of the explosion of my house, fiddling with a new dagger that I stole from a thief that tried to murder a woman. My legs were resting on a wooden table, my eyes glancing at my family’s photo. The frame was completely covered in soot, a left corner containing a dry blood stain. The glass was cracked, with only a few pieces missing. This life wasn’t anything like I had told my mother I would achieve, but it was the closest thing I had to avenging her. I placed the dagger into a metallic bowl that contained multiple other daggers, all from different people, as I made my way to put up a new photo of another person that I had located. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  The wall was covered with many people that I found who worked with the man who blew up my neighborhood, all of them with a red X mark over the person. I grabbed the photo of the next person, a hammer in my other hand. A voice soon echoed in my head, one that I remember quite profoundly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  “Of course I promise! We’re in everything together until the very end, that’s what best friends are for, right?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  “...Right.” I muttered, looking down at the ground as I remembered Mason. His laughter, his smile. The way he was always there for me, even though it would be something that’d tire the hell out of someone. My eyes soon noticed the bracelet on my wrist over the black-sleeved fingerless glove that was connected to my undershirt. I let out a grunt as a tear rolled down my cheek, throwing the hammer… right at my TV.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
