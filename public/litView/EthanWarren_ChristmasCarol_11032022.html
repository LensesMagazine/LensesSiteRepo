                <p class="u-text u-text-body-alt-color u-text-6">Pay attention now. For the story I am about to tell is one you may know fondly. One that reminds you of joy and fills you with the spirit of Christmas. A story of supernatural occurrences, familial bonds, and self reflection. I’m sure you’ve heard this story in countless different ways before, but today I present to you a brand new version. The same story, but told in a much different manner. I hope you enjoy. Now with that out of the way, let us begin this modern day rendition of an old time classic. I present to you my dear readers, A Christmas Carol.<br>It happened seven years ago. The news had finally arrived. Those five horrid words. Everyone knew they were coming, and yet it was still such a shock. “Your uncle has passed away.” Seven years ago on December 24th, 2014, Franklin A. Wheeler had passed away. Heartbreaking news to the family. Life changing news for a poor young boy. Jacob Wheeler. The then eight year old boy was devastated. His uncle, who he seemed closer with than his own father, had passed. Just a day before Christmas. The festive celebration was delayed and instead replaced by a funeral service. The bright lights were substituted with dim candles. The red, green, and white were changed to all black. The poor Jacob had lost his spirit. <br>On that day, more was lost than just Jacob’s uncle. No. Another person had died that day. Jacob himself in a way. I don’t mean Jacob suffered any wounds of any sorts. What I mean is that the boy known as Jacob Wheeler had lost a part of himself that day. One he never thought about getting back. <br>You see, Jacob wasn’t the happiest boy. His life had thrown many struggles his way. Many of which changed him. As the years went by, Jacob changed greatly. A happy peppy boy became a serious and brooding teen. His long black hair was cut to not even pass his chin. The constant despair and aggression seemed to be balanced out by his shorter height. Standing at only five feet and five inches tall. His self isolation was matched by his pale skin. His eyes, however, were a sort of contradiction. The warm hazelnut color would welcome you in. Only to have you blown away by his cold attitude. Jacob was nothing but a dour influence on those around him. Truth be told, nobody truly enjoyed time around him. They may smile when they greet him, but inside they have negative views on his company. Jacob’s actions wouldn’t exactly help his case. His rude remarks and pessimistic attitude only made social experiences worse. <br>However, Jacob didn’t see it that way. He believed everyone else was the problem. Typical teenage stubbornness. To Jacob, the world was wrong.<br>Once upon a fateful Christmas Eve, seven Christmases after the passing of Franklin Wheeler,  The Wheeler house was in a state of chaos. Not due to any bad occurrences, but from the excitement of the holidays. It was Christmas Eve after all. The children ran around and sang festive songs. The adults desperately tried to contain the kids but couldn’t help but join in on their singing. The first floor of the house was decorated in every room. The tree was covered in lights and ornaments. The walls decked with boughs of holly. The stairs to the second floor were wearing a blanket of stockings and reefs. Finally, the second floor was coated in all the decorations one could think of.<br> Everyone in the house was glowing with joy for the holidays. Well, all but one. One room was left barren of any decor. A black painted door with a “Do Not Disturb” sign nailed on. That was the room of Jacob Wheeler, and of course the dog. A Boston Terrier by the name of Marley. A strange name but who are we to judge? While his family celebrated downstairs, Jacob sat on his bed with Marley by his side. He cared not for the festivities. In fact it bothered him. The music blaring and the children running around. It drove Jacob mad. <br>“Merry Christmas Jacob! And God bless your soul!” exhaled a youthful and cheerful voice. The voice belonged to Jacob’s older brother. Only older by three years. He had barged into the room so fast that his merry cheer was the only notice Jacob got of his entrance. Both Jacob and his dog jumped in shock.<br><br>“Jesus! Next time knock.” Said Jacob. “Bullshit!”<br><br>From all the singing and dancing he had done, Jacob’s brother was breathing heavily. His face was red but still retained his natural charming features. His eyes were also a hazelnut color. Unlike Jacob, his personality matched the invitation his eyes sent out. <br><br>“Christmas is bullshit? You’re joking right?” Jacob’s brother said. <br><br>“I’m not joking. Merry Christmas? What do you have to be so merry about? Nothing changes except the money you lost in buying gifts and decorations.” <br><br>“Well you didn’t pay for any of that but you still get it, so why aren’t you merry?”<br>	Lacking a proper rebuttal, Jacob simply sat up straight and said, “Bull!” and then immediately followed it with “Shit!” <br>	<br>“Oh don’t be such a downer.” The older brother said.<br>	<br>“Well how can I be anything else,” returned Jacob, “when I have to put up with this nonsense all the time. Christmas is just a marketing scheme to get people to blow their life’s savings on pointless gifts and even more pointless decoration. It’s a shame so many people actually believe in this. If I could have it my way,” said Jacob, disgruntled, “all the dumbass who take Christmas to heart will drown in their own credit card debt and be buried in a gift wrapped coffin.”<br>	“Jacob!” pleaded the older brother.<br>	<br>“You have your views and I have mine.” Jacob said back.<br>	<br>“Whatever man. Be like that if you really want to. Listen, we're having dinner at midnight. Everyone’s gonna come down and eat. You gonna be there?” <br>	“No thank you. I’ll be asleep by then. No point in staying up for this waste of time.” Jacob said in a purposely rude tone.<br>	<br>“You know, typically family members spend time with their family.” <br>	<br>“Yeah yeah spare me the lecture. Let me sleep. Goodnight.” Jacob then laid back in bed, dismissing his sibling.<br>	<br>“You’ll have to get your gifts!”<br>	<br>“Goodnight!” said Jacob.<br>	<br>“Sweet dreams!”<br>	<br>“Goodnight!” said Jacob once more. This time noticeably aggressive.<br>	<br>With that, Jacob’s brother exited the room. His footsteps grew quiet as he made his way downstairs. Jacob was once again left alone in his room on Christmas. His dog Marley began to whine. He wanted to get out of the gloomy room and see what was happening on the first floor.<br>	<br>“You wanna leave too? Fine. I can’t stay mad at you.” Jacob admitted. <br><br>He then opened the door to release his pet. However there was a strange feeling when the door was opened. It felt as if a gust of wind had flown into the room. Jacob was never one to be scared. He always believed there was a simple and logical explanation to everything. “Just the AC” he thought. Jacob went back to his bed and laid down. His eyes shut as he began to fall into a deep sleep. The overwhelming void of slumber surrounded Jacob. Then suddenly there was a light. A bright light lit the darkness. Jacob went to reach out for the light. He lifted his arm, but nothing moved. His body remained still. He was still asleep and yet he could see the light. He felt the warmth on his body. Then the light began to expand. As if it were growing in size. It quickly reached a point where it was just a couple feet away from Jacob. Suddenly, Jacob woke up. He woke up in a panicked state. Jacob got out of bed. He lowered his feet on the ground he expected to be below him, however he found the ground to be quite different than usual. The black void that was slumber was still present. Everything around Jacob was pitch black except for his bed. It was a frightful experience for him. Jacob was breathing heavily as he scanned his surroundings. His room was engulfed in darkness. <br>“What is this? What the hell is going on? Mom! Dad!” Jacob screamed out into the infinite darkness. There was no response. Not even an echo. Jacob was trembling. Despite how much he would claim to detest them, he truly did worry about where his family was now. He began to shed tears out of fear and worry. The tears stopped for a moment as Jacob noticed something off in the distance. Though it was hard to make out he could see something there. The thing then started to move closer. It was approaching rapidly. As it got closer, light seemed to come off it. Finally the glowing object made a stop. It looked like a white screen. It resembled a T.V. screen. Jacob leaned close to the screen like object before him. As he did the screen immediately expanded. Much like the first light Jacob saw. However, the screen did more than grow. It became one with the void it was in. Every inch of darkness turned to white. Jacob was in awe as he witnessed the void switch from pure black to pure white in just a moment. What happened next, however, is what really left him in shock. The white void around him sprouted colors. Those colors then became a pattern. They took shape as things Jacob recognized. The old rocking chair. The fireplace with no dry wood or evidence of a fire ever being lit. Old paintings of figures that nobody knew. It was the home of Jacob’s uncle Franklin. Jacob’s tears faded. He gathered the will to stand and connect his feet to the floor. To his surprise he could stand perfectly. It was a perfect recreation of his past. <br>“Is anyone home?” Jacob yelled out hoping for an answer. When no voices were heard, he decided to observe his new environment. That’s when he saw it all. The fir tree dresses in red, green, and white. Presents hidden underneath it. Stockings hanging above the old fireplace. The cold boy let out a genuine smile. It was the first time Jacob had done so in years. For a moment he finally could connect Christmas to happy thoughts. Thoughts of listening to his uncle’s stories. Memories of drinking eggnog while watching holiday films. Experiences that were not related to his uncle’s passing. This vision of the past had given Jacob a different perception of his life. It made him see exactly what he had done wrong in the past moments leading up to today. <br>“Uncle Franklin? No. He isn’t here. He shouldn’t be the only thought in my head. Oh my god. I’ve let his deathcontrol me for so long haven’t I?” he questioned out loud. Although he knew there was nobody to respond. With that Jacob closed his eyes. He thought that maybe if he just acted like all these sights around him were gone then they’d leave. He was right, to a degree. After he shut his eyes, the surrounding area returned to its pale white color. And just as quickly as it transitioned to white it then gained colors once more. This time the colors formed a much more present pattern. Jacob opened his eyes to the first floor of his home. This time the room was full of people. All of his family gathered around a beautifully decorated tree. For the first time in a long time Jacob saw the beauty in the family gathering. The unharmonized singing joyous songs. The energetic dancing to said songs. The fresh smell of pie, pudding, and delicious turkey. Jacob couldn’t believe what he was feeling. He finally began to understand what he was missing. At this moment he wondered why he hadn’t gone down with his brother when he was asked. He wondered why he said such horrible things about such a wonderful time of celebration. “I wish I was there. It looks so much fun.” he thought to himself. He was then angry with himself for ever losing faith in such a great holiday. Once more Jacob closed his eyes. This time hoping he’d finally be taken home. Instead he received a more chilling sight. When he opened his eyes he saw nothing. Nothing but pitch black. He couldn’t even see himself. Jacob worried for a moment. He pondered all the explanations for what he was seeing, but he had no answer. Out of the blue Jacob had a wild thought. He realized what he was witnessing. An image of his future. Completely empty. As black as his heart is now. As lifeless as his cruel attitude. This was the fate that was waiting for him. This was the path he paved for himself. Jacob now came to a chilling discovery. He was always the problem. He was always selfish. Rude. Cold. Not just to his family, but to himself. The happy person he once was was yearning to come out again. Jacob decided that perhaps it was time he did. With that, Jacob closed his eyes once more, and this time he finally woke up. He woke up back in his room. No void or white screen. Just his regular room. <br>“Was I dreaming? Hallucinating? Am I crazy?” Many thoughts raced through his head. Until finally he remembered the events that just occurred and what they taught him. Jacob checked the digital clock he kept by his bed. 11:46 PM. It was almost midnight. He hadn’t missed Christmas day. With that he jumped out of bed and ran out his door. He quickly made it to the stairs and slid down the railing. His family members all watched him. Dumbfounded by how unnatural he was acting. <br><br>“So, where’s the dinner? I’m hungry. Make sure not to open the presents without me. I want to eat before we start.” Jacob exclaimed with passion. His brother then came over to him and placed his hand over Jacob’s shoulder.<br><br>“Right this way. Don’t worry Jacob, we’ll wait.” <br><br>With that Jacob went off to eat. Not too long after he opened presents alongside his family. All his cousins and siblings were cheering him on as he unwrapped each box. His parents smiled the biggest smiles of their lives. Jacob had truly changed. Not just for the day, or even the year. Starting that day Jacob began to truly change. He went on to celebrate the holiday every year with his family. Jacob became closer to his family than ever before. Jacob never had any other strange occurrences like the one he had that fateful night. Though he had no need for one. He continued to live his life a changed and better person. Jacob Wheeler had finally found the piece of himself he lost so long ago. With that, Jacob’s story concludes, as well as our time together. So, as the sick children say, God bless Us, Every One!
