                <p class="u-text u-text-body-alt-color u-text-6">The bright sun was high in the sky and was shining its golden rays through a rather run down window of an almost run down residential building. Suddenly, an alarm clock starts blaring. After a couple seconds a frail, lean arm reaches towards the alarm and hits the snooze button. The hand was attached to a small man. The short and skinny man let out a loud groan of exhaustion then pushed his legs out of the bed to stand, his face curled in on a wince as the majority of his weight shifted to his left leg, which was secured in a knee brace. His limp was evident in the slight wobble of his legs when he stood.  At the foot of the bed the name “Thomas” was engraved sloppily in the dark, rough wood. The man slowly limped towards a bathroom in his dull bedroom, and then proceeded to undress and step into the shower. Ten minutes later the man left his room and went into the kitchen of his apartment, which seemed to be in a poor condition. He limped over to the refrigerator, his leg brace squeaking with every step. He grabbed milk from the fridge and poured himself a bowl of cereal. He went to the living room and turned on the T.V. to the news. As he took in spoonfuls of cereal, he glanced down under the couch he sat on.
                  <br /><br />
“Fifteen kidnappings have taken place in the city of Queens just this last year. Multiple bodies of the identified victims have been found in the sewers systems. However, many of the victim’s bodies are still yet to be found. Police have been investigating any leads they can get but no info on the kidnapper has been shared.” 
<br /><br />
The man stared blankly at the T.V. screen. He seemed to have no interest in what he was hearing. He ate his cereal as the reporter kept talking.
<br /><br />
“The bodies that have been found in the sewers are found dismembered. Autopsy reports show that they were seemingly cut using tools such as chainsaws, large knives or machetes. Teeth marks were reported to have been found on the bodies. These reports matched the bodies to the missing persons reports filed over the last year. Police are urging citizens to report any suspicious activities seen and to stay safe when walking home.” 
<br /><br />
By the time the reporter finished, the man had finished his cereal. He then got up and limped over to his kitchen and put his bowl in the sink. He then went back to his room and got fully dressed in a plain black tank top and cargo pants with sneakers that were worn out and battered. He approached a garbage bin in the kitchen and pulled out the bag. He tied it up and then walked out the door of his home. As he stepped outside he was overwhelmed with the sounds of passing cars and people talking. Nothing out of the ordinary for life in the city. He walked up the curb and dropped the garbage bag there. As he did, a dark liquid leaked out of the bag. 
<br /><br />
“Morning Tommy!” A voice yelled out. 
<br /><br />
Tommy turned to his left to see his neighbor waving to him. He smiled and waved back. 
<br /><br />
“You just woke up now?” The neighbor asked. 
<br /><br />
“Yeah, I just got up. Taking out the trash now. How’s Susan?” Tommy asked as if he wanted to exit the conversation already.
<br /><br />
“Oh she’s great! She finally had the kid. We named him Max.”
<br /><br />
“Max huh? That’s a good name. Tell Susan I said hello. Later Morgan.”
<br /><br />
“See you later Tommy.”
<br /><br />
Tommy then went back inside and shut his door behind him. With the T.V. still on, Tommy sat down on his couch and grabbed the remote. He started changing the channels until he found the sports channel. A baseball game was on. Tommy grabbed a half empty beer bottle on the table in front of him and took a sip. Suddenly, a low growling sound came from below. Tommy once again glanced under the couch. Specifically at a cellar door hidden under it. He let out an annoyed sigh and turned up the volume on the remote. As the game went on he drank what was left of his beer. Tommy then got up and limped over to his garbage bin only to realize there was no bag in it. He let out a loud sigh and then opened a drawer in his kitchen to grab a garbage bag. As he did he cut his finger on a loose blade that was in the drawer. After letting out a mild cry, Thomas quickly grabbed a first aid kit from a cabinet above and applied a bandage. Afterwards he reached for a garbage bag, put it in the bin, and dropped the empty bottle in. Tommy sat back down on the couch to finish watching the game. Fifteen minutes later he glanced down at his watch. It was 11:39 A.M. As a homerun was made Tommy jumped up in excitement, but then fell back down due to the unexpected shift of weight onto his left leg. When the game ended Tommy picked up the remote and started changing the channels once more. After about five minutes of searching he finally gave up. Tommy then let out a sigh of annoyance and turned off the television. He stood up and walked to his fridge and pulled out another beer bottle. He chugged half of it and put it back in the fridge. Tommy let out another sigh before walking to the left of his couch. He placed his hands on it and mustered all of his strength to push the couch over to the right. Under the couch was the old cellar door he kept paying attention to. It was sealed by a lock that was covered in rust. Tommy reached into his pocket and pulled out an old key. He stared intensely at the key, and then unlocked the door and opened the hatch. Under the cellar door was a flight of stairs that led down a dark tunnel. He flipped a switch on the wall and lit up the entire stairway revealing a door at the bottom. Tommy went down the stairs carefully so as to not trip and closed the cellar door behind him. As Tommy walked down the stairs, soft groans could be heard. Once he reached the door he took a deep breath and opened it. Behind the door was a big room filled with chains, meat hooks, power tools, crates, and a work table in the middle with a drape over it. Around all the walls were tunnels that wreaked sewage and waste. As Tommy walked in, the soft groaning turned into muffled screaming. Tommy then pulled the drape off the work table revealing an elderly woman tied down and gagged. She was screaming and crying endlessly. Through her restraints and gag she was begging for help. Her pleas were met with a cold blank stare from Tommy. 
<br /><br />
“Try not to make too much noise. You don’t wanna piss Max off. It will only make things worse.” Tommy said to the woman as a malicious smirk grew on his face. “Come on out Max!”
<br /><br />
Suddenly another door in the back of the room flew open. Out of it, lumbered freakishly tall and muscular man. His skin was dark brown, wrinkly and resembled the texture of leather. There were stitches riddled throughout his body. His horribly shaped back kept him in a hunched over position with his shoulders at uneven heights. His eyes were small and surrounded by his swollen skin. His hair went down to his shoulders and was dirty and unkept. Grimy red stains covered his shirt black shirt and pants. He walked with a limp as his body could barely manage to uphold such a stature. The deformed man walked over to a rack of power tools on the wall and extended his stitched and disfigured arm towards a chainsaw. The tool was covered in dry blood. The woman’s cries turned into screams as she squirmed with what little strength she had. As she cried, the giant monster of a man grew angry. He started roaring with rage as he revved up his saw. The beast approached the woman and then turned his head to face Tommy. 
<br /><br />
“Go on Max. Have your fun.” 
<br /><br />
After hearing this, the beast identified as Max roared with excitement and raised his saw into the air. The edges of his crusted lips began to turn slightly upwards into an evil, sinister smile. Thomas turned his back to the ensuing violence and walked towards a pile of crates set aside in the corner of the underground basement. He reached into the crate and pulled out a stained black apron. He stood straight up, wincing as his weight shifted onto his braced leg. He let out a heavy sigh and looked up at a manhole cover on the roof of the basement. 
<br /><br />
“It really is crazy what kinda things you can get away with these days. It really is crazy what can happen down under these streets.” 
<br /><br />
Thomas turned back to face his comrade. He sat down at a chair beside the pile of crates, once again letting out a sigh. He watched with a blank face as Max was well at work with his saw. It was nothing unusual for Thomas to see. Screams, roars, and sounds of a saw echoed throughout the basement. And nobody but the ones within would ever hear.
