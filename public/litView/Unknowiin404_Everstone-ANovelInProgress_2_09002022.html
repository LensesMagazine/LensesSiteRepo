                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“A mall down south of Blight Avenue has had a recent attack, containing traces of the vigilante known as Melon. Video footage of the man was unavailable to get captured, as cameras were taken down mysteriously before the event. It has been the sixth time this year with a scenario like this that contained the vigilante’s name, and critics are wondering about the man’s next target. Detective Zack and his crew had volunteered for an attempt in an investi–” There was the sound of glass shattering as a hammer was launched at the screen. A grunt was heard, followed by footsteps. Ray was struggling to keep his sanity, figuring that he’d have to move somewhere else since people were now hearing about him and his work.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The teen had no idea how to get rid of evidence, the only tool that aided as to what he does are movies. Alas, he was a lone wolf. Not a single reminder that a team would be the key to his vengeance had fiddled with his mind, so hunting down the goons who worked with his parents’ murderer was his best shot. Not exactly the greatest, but it’s where it got him to his current abode. An abandoned store was the perfect home, even though it was full of rat-like creatures. Though, they did make the best companions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Fiddling with a dagger, he researched old history about the tyrant, writing down more names that he found; where they lived, what they ate, etc. Ray had remembered that he had to help out with some affair at a local park, but it wasn’t important. Things such as that weren’t a big deal to the adolescent since the explosion.. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Since the disappearance of Mason.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
He leaned back into the raggy old swivel seat he’d found in an alley, staring at the ceiling. Has this really gone that bad? His sanity broken like a crushed up mug that couldn’t possibly be repaired? A sigh of distress escaped his mouth before he stood to gather his materials. Once at the door of the building, he hesitated to grab a circular mask that hung from a coat rack. It had the shape of a plate, though it was a sliced half of a watermelon–his mother’s favorite fruit. A strange memory of his mother and him had slipped into his mind, sitting on the porch and discussing the future as they watched a sunset. They had the watery fruit in both of their hands, a smile stretching as far as the eye could see on their faces. Ray made eye contact with the opened smiley face that was drawn onto the mask, blinking back a tear. As if his old friend was there, he smiled on cue, leaving his “home”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Mertia was a nice town, no one minding his eyes. That was the important part. The other was mainly about his onslaught for information. As long as he didn’t wear his mask in front of the public, attention wouldn’t be drawn. Ray waved to a few people whom he befriended a few days ago, an elderly Mertian woman gracefully handing him a few samples of some food she whipped up. He thanked her, the senior nodding in response. Ray now focused his attention on his path towards the park, that unconscious voice making a remark about how he ended up going after all. Well, why wouldn’t he? A man waved at him from the entrance, a smile slipping onto his face before a pair of sunglasses were planted on the bridge of his nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The sun hadn’t been that hot at the moment, but he didn’t trust people who he seemed to be friends with. He then mentally scolded himself for forgetting his mask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“Ray! I knew you’d make it!” The insect-like man had hovered over to his side, smiling up at Ray. It was there when he realized how small he was in comparison to himself.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“Well yeah, why wouldn’t I?” He smiled back, repeating the thought that he responded to his conscience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“I don’t know, you look like a person who would just ignore what others say.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“Not true.” Ray scoffed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“I- I mean–!” The man waved his hands in front of himself, “Since we met you had this attitude towards others that had me thinking, ‘hm, I don’t think he likes people’, so I just thought that–!” A pat on his shoulder made his mouth shut. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“If you had something bad happen to you and then suddenly end up somewhere where people acted friendly, how’d you feel?” Ray lowered his tone, pulling the shorter man to a hug. He remembered it was an act of comfort only from the best. The other paused, letting out a sigh of defeat.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“Yeah.. I guess you’re right.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“Yep, you really are …?” An awkward silence filled the air as Ray tried to remember something, a laugh breaking it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“Did you forget my name again? For the third time?” He chuckled, pulling the hug apart. Pink filled up Ray’s freckled cheeks as he made a sheepish expression behind his shades. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“What are the chances of me saying yes?” The other rolled his eyes, giving him a pat on the chest.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“I think it’s eighty-five percent.” He smiled, “Bandit.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ray nodded his head, making a mental note to himself. A small punch was given to his arm, as laughter came out of the other’s mouth.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“Don’t forget it this time.” Bandit’s expression changed as he made a small fist, “Or this won’t be going on your arm anymore.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
He lifted his hands up, “Alright! Alright! I won’t. I promise.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Bandit smiled, getting a hold of the other’s hand before yanking it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“C’mon! We’re gonna be late if we don’t move!” Ray let out a yelp as they both ran off without a warning, trying his best to catch up to the younger teen’s pace.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now Bandit was known to be one of the sweetest kids around, helping others and reminding people of who they were inside. His reputation was great, and worried that if he messed something up, it’ll all go crashing down. He was only sixteen, styling his braids in any way possible. Magenta painted irises made up that space that his wide eyes consisted in, along with gills that peaked out of the sides of his head. Citizens assumed that since he had fins, he needed water. But he continued to remind them that he wasn’t like the Sirens who lived in the oceans, and breathed fine air just like them. His mother was a Siren, his father was a Mothlian. That explained why his left sclera was pitch black–why Ray chose him as his “friend”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But the peach-blonde wasn’t bothered by that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Bandit pulled his scarf over his head as they ducked behind a navy-blue bush, Ray following his actions by pulling his hood up as well. Both boys were staring at a fountain, teal water pouring out of it. The younger teen’s eyes sparkled as he watched the view, Ray more interested in who was sitting on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“Just on time! Are you excited?!” He whisper-yelled, every inch of excitement shrilling down his spine. But the masked vigilante had his full attention on the stranger. The sight of jet black hair made his heart ache. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“Wait here.” Ray stood up, Bandit’s smile disappearing as he continued to yell in a hushed tone.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
He walked toward the bystander, his heart rate boosting as if it were a racing car. Ray hesitated, tapping on the stranger’s shoulder. A familiar smile was implanted on his face as he watched the hair move in response. But it sank too soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“You need something, kid?” The woman in front of him asked, quite concerned of the attention she gathered from a stranger.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“..Sorry, wrong person.” His voice teared up, Ray immediately running away as he left the lady completely clueless.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Bandit chased him, finding the broken teen under a cherry tree a few minutes later. Its flowers had bloomed, the petals floating to the ground as if the whole scene had been nothing but a fantasy. The sound of sadness filled the air, with Ray being the broken record that continued to play continuously. He had his knees curled up to his chest while he wept, hood surprisingly still over his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“I’m so sorry that happened to you …That was bad timing, don’t you think?” There wasn’t a response after Bandit apologized, the boy kneeling down before placing a hand on the other’s shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“Maybe we should talk about it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
That got Ray’s attention. Oh how he wanted to tell it all, his origin story. To Bandit, Ray was a hero. But deep within him, through all of those screams he knew he wasn’t. The poor boy had to know eventually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Not like this, unfortunately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
He lifted his head, throwing the sunglasses to the side before wiping his face with his black sleeve.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Finally for the first time since he met Bandit, he made eye contact. His left eye shone in a deep, violent magenta, his right glistening in bright, crimson red. Somehow, they complimented each other. Bandit was sure of it. But… Why now? Why had he not shown him earlier? It was almost every time when he saw Ray in public that he wore the sunglasses, as if he was shunned by them. Bandit himself hadn’t done the same thing due to his black eye-whites, why had Ray done this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As if he read his mind to answer his question, the other stood up to speak, holding his hand out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“I’ll explain this all in a few minutes. Right now, you need to come with me.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
~*~<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Back in his swivel seat from earlier, he questioned his sanity once more. This time however, he wasn’t alone. Bandit was in awe with the multiple items that were all over the place. How he’d arrange everything in order, he wasn’t so sure. It was then when he noticed the mask, the correlations with the weapons. It all made sense.
“So you’re Melon?” Bandit spoke so suddenly, catching Ray off guard. He blinked as if he was completely clueless. He needed intel.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“Melon…?” The boy leaned forward, urging Bandit to continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“Yeah, the mayor mentioned multiple times of some vigilante killing people but then killing serial killers. Said he went by the name ‘Melon’. Witnesses described some guy with one blue-purple wing wearing a watermelon mask with a smiley face on it.” He lifted the mask from the wall, “This is the only one I’ve seen. Plus, you’re the only person in the entire city that I’ve met that has one wing. Specifically that color.” A grunt escaped from Ray’s mouth as he stood up. He went toward Bandit, moving his hand off of the mask. As he turned to go back to his chair, Bandit spoke up once more.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“Why do you kill?” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ray paused, turning his head to glare down at the boy. He was pushing it, and Bandit knew it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“I know you told me that all of that happened in your life, why you hide your eyes, why you came here.. You didn’t explain the part as to why you murderer all of those people you target.” His voice was gentle, reassuring; sounded worried. That made Ray cringe.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The vigilante turned to grab the dagger that he fiddled with hours ago, pointing at the air as he spoke. “All of those people know and work with the person who killed my parents. You should’ve connected the dots by now. But I doubt you could’ve since you’re just a kid.” Bandit frowned at the remark, scoffing. “Uh, you’re a kid too?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“I’m eighteen.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“That’s still young!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“I turn nineteen in two months.” The other tried to come up with another comeback, only to let out a huff in defeat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“Well, I could learn! If I tag along with you in this, I’ll know how to!” He skidded to the torn down swivel chair, hopping into it as he sat. “I’ll be the guy in the chair!” 
Ray shook his head, brows furrowing as he marched to Bandit. He yanked the boy out of his seat, shoving him aside. “I’m fine on my own, thanks but no thanks.” He spun around, halting the movement with his heel before fiddling with the dagger on his fingers. Bandit on the other hand, wasn’t going to take it for an answer. “Did you find the person who killed your parents?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“I’m close to piecing it toge–”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“Did you find the person’s location?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“No, but I–”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“Did all of those people tell you anything related to–”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“ALRIGHT I GET YOUR POINT!” Ray stabbed the edge of the desk with the dagger, sinking it into the wood. As he watched the younger teen freeze in shock, he noticed how he put fear into people. What would his mother say about this? Letting out a soft exhale, he stood up and put a hand on Bandit’s shoulder with a hurt expression. “Sorry. I’m sorry. For everything.” He went back to his chair, gripping the bridge between his nose as he pondered in distress. “I shouldn’t have pulled you into this. You’re only sixteen with a normal, happy life. It can’t..” A sigh, “It can’t be worked out. You can’t help.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Bandit watched with a worried look. From what he learned, Ray used to be like him. Though not a broken life at first, he was absolutely happy. He finally had great parents, a brother, and an amazing best friend. But it all got taken away. The boy hesitantly strode to him, rubbing Ray’s shoulder with his thumb in comfort. “It can. All you need to do is to hope for the best. ‘Ts what I do every day.” There came a weak laugh that broke the silence between them.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“Sounds miserable.” Bandit’s smile came back as he tried to look cheerful.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“It kind of is, but it’s better than sulking in your seat after killing people.” Ray let out a groan as he left his seat. He walked over to a certain corner of the store that now suddenly caught Bandit’s eye, the boy wondering why he hadn’t noticed it as soon as he walked in. It was the most obvious spot out of the entire building, followed by the custom living room area that Ray had built by himself. A cracked picture frame containing a small family of four was on a nightstand, Bandit assumed that every piece of furniture that was inside was what Ray had salvaged from the explosion. He started to feel bad for the guy, honestly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The vigilante, now standing in front of the covered bulletin board, ripped the wall paper off which revealed the various sources and pictures all relating to the explosion that took his family’s life away. There was even a section as to multiple victims who disappeared rather than dying during the incident. To Ray, that signified something. Bandit stood in awe, as he had misunderstood the situation. “I’m so sorry, I didn’t realize–” He began, the other lifting a hand for silence. “It’s ‘aight. I figured I needed to show you sooner or later. But since you started asking all of those questions, I just couldn’t wait anymore. Things could’ve gone..” Ray took a quick glimpse at the dagger that he had struck at the desk earlier. “..deadly.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Bandit was astounded. Here he thought that the guy was a soft person at heart, and that he could come out of his shell. Now he knew. “Your anger is something new, right?” He hesitated, Ray giving a slow nod. The poor boy was soon too afraid to go on, but he needed to know. If anything, he could just fly away, given the fact that the older male only had one wing. “I could help.. Ease the pain. You don’t gotta lash it out on people, y’know.” Another nod. No one since Mason had calmed the vigilante down, though it was worth a shot. His wing rested at ease, the tension decreasing as the young boy came over to embrace him. They hugged it out, one hoping that he didn’t die on the spot and the other fantasizing about his old friend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Weeping soon enough filled the room.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
~*~<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A small bell rang as Ray entered a nearby grocery store, receiving multiple looks from others. Bandit aided in reassurance, which seemed to help for a while. Things could’ve gone better if he hadn’t thrown his pair of navy-blue sunglasses to the bush. They gathered food and materials for their journey, thanking the cashier on the way out. And so, the whispering began. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“So we leave? Just like that?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“Just like that.” Ray had circled a city on a map that had been placed on a long table, Bandit hovering over as he revised the plan. “And you’re sure that this guy.. What’s his name? Western dude with the orange streak in his hair?” The other rolled his eyes as he scoffed, quickly grabbing a printed photo from a drawer. He returned, dropping it onto the wooden table. “He’s a junker, goes by the name Bubbly. Though it doesn’t really fit his personality anymore.” Bandit blinked as he observed the black-and-white image, processing the information. “How come? You met him?” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ray let out a huff, crossing his arms. “Hell yeah I met him. He used to be this great guy, who next thing you know, becomes your father figure. Spoke about cowboy stuff, mentioned a few raccoons that he kept as a kid. Guy’s obsessed with them. Though, when I went back to visit him, he barely spoke. He’d say words like ‘over there’ and ‘in the back’, nothing else. Huh.” He lifted the photo, Bandit hovering closer as he got a better view. “Wonder what happened to the guy. I called him ‘Dad’ once. ‘Was a mistake, fifteen years was a weird era.” Dropping the image back on the table, he shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The younger male caught it mid-air, looking at it himself. “What did he do? As a junker, I mean.” Ray was now sitting on a leather chair now, resting his legs above a table as he folded his arms over his head. “Well, he collected anything that anyone thought was broken. It was a funny technique he had, claiming ‘it can’t be fixed, sorry’ and once the customer goes away, boom. Fixes it all up and sells it at a high price. He does the same thing for cars, though it's tricky when someone really knows their vehicle a little too well.” He chuckled, reminiscing as he mimicked the man’s voice, “‘That darn humie didn’t let me keep it. It was clear as hell that it was rotten but he just yanked the wheel ‘outta my hand and left. ‘Buncha rust-buckets.’” The duo laughed, silent once again as Ray lost his smile. It was a genuine one, too. One that Bandit hadn’t seen since they met. “What’s his real name? –If it’s a sensitive matter, I won’t say it. I just want to know.” The youngling blurted, Ray letting out a huff as he walked back to the table. “Miguel. And I’m sure if you don’t piss him off, he’ll be fine with you calling him by his real name. Oh, by the way. Don’t make fun of his accent. It ticks him off instantly.” With a nod, the two headed out to get supplies for their journey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
That was when Ray had forgotten the fact that he didn’t have his shades anymore, and grabbed his watermelon-smiley mask instead. That was when the staring began.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A hand on his shoulder broke his trance as Bandit and he were both at the town’s border. Fortunately, it wasn’t in the direction he came from as a mere thirteen-year-old. He tilted his head down as an indication that he was looking right at the younger male. Bandit smiled at him, letting him know that it was all okay, he’ll be fine, yadda yadda yadda. This kind of attention was starting to irritate him, but at least it was something. They both let their attention go to the broken plains ahead of them. Ray noticed the difference between the town’s plant job and the outer region’s. It was not taken care of, multiple weeds and vines visible in the distance. And the trees–should he say worn down twigs instead? Dry red-velvet leaves were all over the place, most likely to crunch at their feet if they began to walk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So they did.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The duo began their march to Strowville, a land that consisted of nothing but dry grass tumbleweeds. There were flowers however, along with lampposts covered in dust and vines. “You could take off your mask, y’know.” Bandit broke the uncomfortable silence once again, Ray nodding his head in response. But as he made the effort to lift it above his mouth, the light of the outer world halted him from doing so. He felt his eyes stinging from the sudden brightness, shutting his eyes as he recovered. Never again, he thought.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The sound similar to that of a Terran “eagle” roared above the clouds, throughout the empty wastelands. It was Ray who had to defeat the predators that stalked them, his keen sense of movement aiding in his attacks. Bandit watched, trying to fight as well. That earned a broken leg and scolding from the vigilante. When dusk settled, the duo set up a campsite–Bandit doing most of the building as Ray gathered a large amount of firewood. As the younger male stood in awe of his creation, Ray quickly “fixed it” by dividing it into two. To his discontent, Bandit knew that earning his trust was going to be more difficult than what he had presumed. The next morning wasn’t as bad however, as breakfast was already made for him. Ray had packed up everything again while Bandit was asleep, and decided to get a headstart. The younger male moved frantically while stuffing the camp materials into his bag, eating his food as he flew to catch up with Ray. “If you want to still tag along, you gotta get used to me!” He whistled innocently, a smirk slipping onto his face. Good thing he wore the mask. Throwing a child-like tantrum, Bandit punched the other’s arm many times once he landed on the ground, forgetting the short temper that Ray had. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It took only two days of walking and quarrels before they reached Strowville, a town that underestimated Bandit’s expectations. Ray was only impressed by a pinch, since he came here as mentioned earlier. Technology was certainly an improvement, with transparent subways and advanced horse transportation. Bandit was astounded, pointing out multiple things that he did not have back in Mertia. The vigliante let out a soft chuckle at his friend’s new discoveries, his eyes darting for the sight of the small workshop that he loved as a young adolescent. They continued to stroll down the avenue, people greeting them from every corner. Not one person gave Ray a dirty look. He began to ponder what gave him the urge to leave. They soon made their way to a corner that was not filled with any light at all. It may have been the oldest and only building that still had technology at its youngest stage, a flashing sign that read “Open”.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
