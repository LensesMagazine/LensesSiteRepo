                  <br />
—<br />
Fame, riches, power. That’s what everyone would want to achieve true happiness, right? All of my life family and friends have warned me to let things play into my hands, to have patience, as “all good things come to those who wait”. But I was anxious: what if I wasn’t fit to be a conquistador? What if I was made to fail those who I loved? What if he took everything from me just so that I can just be nothing but a puppet for him? The rules have to be followed… they must always be followed, I can’t break the rules, his words are his order and I am to obey what he says…<br />
“There you are!” Atlas marched towards me, hips swinging with pride as he already knew his position throughout this entire regime of conquering cities. I wore my dog-mask, heeling in his direction. “What are your wishes now, Master Hecatellis?” The sour river poured down my mouth as I patiently waited for the heir’s command. “My wish is far more great than what any other person can grant me, though you’re perfect for the job. Since you’ve been so obedient, I’ll let you be the puppeteer this time, and allow you to be off the leash.” He floated up to my height, his soft face inches away from my own, almost as if one sudden move could cause an explosion of emotions. The mask fell from my lips, and he was greeted with a devilish smirk no one other than he would recognize. I greatly thanked him with a peck on the back of his palm, hungrily dashing to the room that held my family of toy soldiers. At last, the strings were cut off.<br />
I will not fail him, and will strive to be the successor I was born to be. The newborn grin couldn’t stay off my pale skin, as I was so eager to start achieving land by land. How could I put it? Shrills of pleasure ran through my veins as I watched towns burst into grains of sand, maniacal siren-like laughter exploding through my teeth. Each new territory I had gained from blood and tears were painfully given up by each leader, all the more dragging me close to my destiny. Mother would be so proud. It was up to thirteen cities that I have conquered, and Atlas had not reeled me back to the castle. A missile was ordered to gracefully land on the next city, Trahhar, and with that it’ll be an easy snatch to move on to finish off the last few cities that I need to have the entire country under my rule.<br />
Trahhar wasn’t so easy, as one distinct townsfolk had been filled with so much rage, that I had even taunted him to take me on. Though it’d seem that I had underestimated the boy. With one wing, the other noticeably severed and swimming in an ocean of red, he lunged to the side and into the forest. I laughed in his misery, freezing at a sudden contact that my arm so foolishly had done with a spear that the teenager fired out of my sight. The soldiers quivered in fear at the sound of a hiss, the bull inside of me already seeing red. I will end that one-winged pest one way or another.<br />
The frail march towards the next city continued.<br />


<br /><span style="font-size: 250%">Everstone - In The Eyes of Misery</span><br />
—<br />
A feared tyrant marched through the dead prairie, the adolescent himself quite famished and satisfied with his recent kill. But it wasn’t enough to satisfy the neverending quench that he had ever since his mother had asked him that frightful favor; a promise that would shape the country of Weignview to ruin and terror. Soldiers tiredly begged to themselves for this wish to be fulfilled soon, for their craniums were on the verge of exploding. The reddened sights that they had seen of dismantled organs being tossed in the air like popcorn kernels were enough for only one time. It’s not as if they had all been trained for war, right?<br />
Zachariah’s executioners halted at the gates of heaven, silencing as they gazed at the quiet city: townsfolk prancing about, families joyfully spending a windy day in the air. One would also stand by and watch the sight, similar to that activity of dolphin-watching or bird-watching, all men and women stopped to relieve their unsightly memories just to gawk at the flying humanoids in the air. Zachariah himself was also humming in silence, pursing his lips as he felt pity for the magical figures in the sky.<br />
“Fear not dear friends, for once this city is ours, they will be flying for us all the time.” He sneered, the tyrant at once ordering for the bomb to be planted already.<br />
On the other side, the humble heroine soared through the air, hoisting his friend from infancy by the hand; it’s almost surprising as to how the taller male aside was even holding onto the delicate boy. They both enjoyed each other’s company, a symphony of childish giggles adding onto the flaps that Raymond’s wings produced. The boy dropped the other off on the rooftop of his home, both aparting with waves and repeated ‘goodbyes’, bidding each other farewell. To his dismay, that was the last time they’d ever see the other.<br />
The winged male descended onto his front yard, his mother already greeting him as he neared, her bright face of color fading as the piercing shriek of a missile broke the sound barrier, Raymond attempting to at least shield the both of them with the small wings that he had–his mother made the better shield out of him however, with her giant rose-feathered wings. A salty drop rolling down the boy’s cheek commenced the concert of bombs, many already taking the lives of those that were already in the air. The tyrant’s laugh was the other thing that was audible throughout the explosions.<br />
As the dust settled, Zachariah and his toy soldiers marched politely onto the board, a majority of them in shock at the aftermath. From each city they conquered, never had they intended to wipe out a large portion of the population such as Trahhar. Silence substituted the once melodic streets, not a single movement detected. The city was similar to a crushed sandcastle, almost imitating the same shape and texture: dust and grains. The mayor’s body was found, as was Raymond’s mother. Zachariah smiled as he assumed that he could rebuild the city into his own personal paradise. There was no more use for this city of dust. The army slowly sludged to start their signature dance through the destruction to their next destination when they all froze at the sound of weeping.<br />
Droplets fell onto the lifeless body of his mother, Raymond’s personality switching to that of a wild animal. He was seeing red. The tyrant smirked, foreshadowing the various experiments and tests that they could run on such a fine creature back at their base camp. He frowned at the sight of one measly wing, nevertheless lifted a hand to send an order. But he was interrupted. The boy shouted in desperation for an answer as to why Zachariah had performed such a disaster. A laugh followed, and the boy tried to find a compromise, desiring for the other to come join him.<br />
Raymond spit at the tyrant, making a dash for the forest with what he had left of his gorgeous periwinkle-feathered wings–that being one of them. As he ran, he smiled through his tears at the sound of distress. A spear impaled Zachariah’s arm, satisfying the broken heroine by a bit. But it wasn’t enough. His grin developed to a frown the more he ran from several bullets; one haste pause and he’d surely be in the same place as his comrades; the tyrant cursed the hindering boy after starting up his feared family of soldiers, glaring at the forest all the meanwhile as they marched.<br />


<br /><span style="font-size: 250%">Everstone - In The Eyes of Innocence</span><br />
—<br />
“Make sure to stay out of trouble, alright, Ray?” Mother seemed to suffocate my face with pecks, and I laughed all the meanwhile, her feathers even tickling the sides of my neck. I loved my mother. No really, I do. She had the scent of an angel–or if that’s what they’d smell like. I gave my mother one last reassuring embrace, digging my head into her stomach. “You know I never run into trouble, Ma.” I cooed, my grin widening as she gave one last peck on my cheek before I flew off to meet Gardner.<br />
My childhood friend and I were attached to the hip. Others assumed that we were brothers, and some might have assumed different subjects that I won’t even get into because, well, I’m only thirteen.<br />
“Ray!” He pipped, and I handed him one of my signature bear hugs. Although, I might be too small for that. I finished my monologue, and we played a few games, dug holes in the sand bar that was in a nearby playground, and that’s when Gardner suggested that he take me flying. I wasn’t so sure about that. See, Gardner can’t fly, unlike me. Different species into inseparable friends, I took him into the skies, forgetting at first that he was a bit heavy. But my determination and persistence didn’t stop me from swinging him in the air as my wings fluttered in the air.<br />
A sigh of relief escaped my lips as the calming breeze brushed against my feathers, the sound of my friend cheering keeping me away all the meanwhile. Sometimes if I were to fly alone, I’d fall asleep. Similar to some avian creatures on Terra, we Elytrians also stay flying while we sleep. Crazy, right?<br />
“Swing me up into the air and let me go! You’ll catch me, I know you will!” He suggested, but I backfired and shook my head with a smile. We soared in the air, greeting a couple of neighbors and friends along the way.<br />
Trahhar was a peaceful city, with Elytrians making up 80% of the population. Their mystifying wings were known to hypnotize the usual bystander, and it wouldn’t hurt to stand by and watch such a performance. Though if one Elytrian were to dance while in the air, that’d be inappropriate for younger viewers such as toddlers. Services such as those are requested frequently and bought by non-elytrians, though there are many of us who perform it for free. Alas, those are usually lovers showing off their rituals of lust for each other. It truly is a remarkable culture I’d say, and I’m proud to be one of them.<br />
Lost in my thoughts, the sun had begun to set over the horizon. I peeked over to my friend, who was already starting to drift off in my hands, which were also so exhausted from holding him that I could just let go of him right here and now. A chuckle escaped me at the gag that I shook it off, gliding in the direction of his house.<br />
“Wake up idiot, we’re here. You’re snoozing and my arms are dying.” I spoke softly, giggling as he pretended to be in deep slumber. With a kick and threats to let go of him, the taller male climbed through the window in the roof, leading him into his room. I smiled at the assurance that he was safe, starting my long (quick) journey back home.<br />
My mother smiled at the sight of me, extending her arms to catch me. I rolled my heterochromatic eyes at the warm ritual that she’d do each time I came home, giving into it. My arms moved on their own, wings fluttering in thrill and excitement to feel my mother’s embrace.<br />
But it all came crashing down.<br />
With swift movement, my mother pulled me into the expected yet rushed embrace, covering her rose-petal wings all over my personal body, the incoming scream of what sounded like a sizzling kettle increasing. My heart dropped as I familiarized the surroundings to that of an action movie I’d seen as a child. This was truly real, it was happening, what will happen to my mother? My father? My friends? Pain vibrated through my eyelids as my muscles were clenched tight, my eyes involuntarily closed due to the sudden fear that I had as bombs went off all around me. I heard my mother struggling to stand. A yelp escaped my own lips as I felt a bone shatter and snap, tear off from one of my limbs. Terror and shouts were heard all around me, but I focused on one audible noise.<br />
Laughter. What monster would be laughing at a time like this?<br />
It felt like I was waking up from a bad dream, though I knew it was very much real. (I tried pinching myself. It didn’t work.) My mother was painted on display, my father somewhere underneath the rubble and glass shards. Sure enough he turned up, bubbling mountains of organ tissue smeared across the large pile of shattered bones and wall. My eyes didn’t take off my mother however, a cupped hand on my mouth to cover a broken wail. Even in death she looked angelic, a professional artist’s scrapped painting put to the side like garbage even though it was considered mystifying. My blood boiled as hers seeped all over the ground; missing limbs and several guts spilled onto the ground as the lower half of her body was missing and crushed into a mix of bloodied goop and bone particles, intestines splayed out like a bunch of cooked noodles.<br />
The laughter came again, and my head had never spun around so fast, I felt like I could’ve accidentally spun and snapped my neck. I wiped my unknown tears that were all over my face, along with bits of grime and dust. My eyes landed on the figure that boasted about all the destruction. It was kid of about my age, seated upon a throne-like tank, snarking at my cry for help.<br />
If I could remember what I told the guy, I would’ve, if it weren't for my ears ringing from the lullaby of bombs from earlier. Although my hearing wasn’t at its best, I consciously picked up a wooden spear-like piece from the floor near me, calculating at which point would be best to throw it at my mother’s murderer. Sure, it was not right of me to instantly put him to blame for my mother’s death, but I think the sight of the boy sitting on a giant tank would be pretty self-explanatory. I dashed for the safest place that I assumed was okay for me, laughing at the whimper that I indeed heard from the boy. That and the multiple bullets that were being shot at me, causing me to increase my speed (I tried flying, and to my dismay I felt great pain in my left wing-joint. Turning around, I gasped in panic. It was gone).<br />
The boy called out for me, cursing me even, that I was a wretch. True, I was. He was right about that. One thing was for sure though: I would never look at life the same as it was. And if I ever saw that split-colored tyrant again… well. He’d be just like Mother.<br />
