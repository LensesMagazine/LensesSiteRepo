                <p class="u-text u-text-body-alt-color u-text-6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sand grazed along the ground as large gusts of wind transported each grain, multiple if you will, enough to give someone an asthma attack only to kill them within seconds. I was almost grateful that my colleague had forced me to wear the masks that he had made for us, for we would’ve never gotten across this mildew desert of amber. My ankle joints were screaming at me to stop, the effect of dehydration hitting me almost suddenly. I imagined punching myself for not having a good sense of self care. But alas, I couldn’t stop. Turning back now would be the worst mistake I’d ever made in my last twenty-nine years. “We’re coming up on !” The aquatic man chipped up beside me. A large mass in the middle of my throat was produced due to the anxiety building up beneath my pores; never had I ever been this nervous to approach my adolescent hometown. As I recalled, the last time I had a feeling like this was when I was committing my first accusation: the struggling noise of a middleman’s words hopelessly running off his tongue as he so mercilessly begged for me to stop, his skin almost matching the tint of my periwinkle wing before a sickening crack was emitted from his tracheal vertebrae; with pride, I dropped the lifeless doll after getting my answer.<br /><br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rivetville used to be a homely villa consisting of talented creatures pirouetting among the streets. The small city was known for its grand focus on the arts, and had schools of everything that pertained to the specific gift that an individual would be a master at, deciding that they would do it for the rest of their lives. Unlike any other city that I have scavenged around for blood, talent was a huge factor on the state’s economy and government, ranging from the best architects who would build beautiful eco-friendly buildings that look like they came out of a fantasy book to the grand musicians and artists that combine their powers to give off the energy that the city folk would need on a daily basis: a life full of color.<br /><br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cursed my brain as it formed a heartwarming illusion for me in the distance. That time was recalled as clear as daylight. Delusions of my own youthful laughter ringed through my ears, the husky voice of my father figure swinging me through the air as we danced and played throughout a festival’s activities; explosions of color bursting and sprouting on the pitch-ember night sky. A pit of vomit swam up my stomach as I was pulled back into the present, my gaze averting to my right paw. My lip quivered in fear as I realized that there was no way in hell that I’d be able to finish the job. Forcefully plucking the aquatic insectoid into a dark corner between wooden saloons, I notified him about my sudden anxiety and its heartbreaking origin.<br /><br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indigo-rust pebbles submitted to our giant skyscrapers, the screams escaping their translucent mouths as we walked to a house that looked like a couple years old. If Terrans were to suddenly visit and take a quick glance at the building, they’d say that the home looked similar to that of a wealthy being’s living quarters. This wasn’t the case for the middle-class here on Rivetville. My tongue shoved down the reborn bulge in the middle of my throat, trembling as I crept up to a coincidentally open window. My father-figure’d always fancied a shaft of natural air every once in a while. The insectoid man parroted warnings and “all clear”s to me as I trampled through the scarlet blades of grass, wondering if the old man was still alive to this day. The other had noticed the sudden fear on my face, planting a hand on my shoulder. “Hey, it’ll all be okay. He’ll still love you for the person you are.” Pride swelled in my heart as I smiled back, releasing a breath that I didn’t know I was capable of holding. The smile however, wasn’t one of contentment. It was of pity.<br /><br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hardly persuading for Bandit to keep watch behind me, I swiftly leapt into the window, feet too fragile to even land on the ground. So I clung onto the ledge; if seen from a far distance it’d be really stupid to assume what I’d be doing. To most folks, I’d be a burglar. And I’d laugh, chuckle even, with a haunting smile that’ll pierce my next victim’s memory until it’s the only thing that they could remember of me in the afterlife. They’re not wrong. A meaty punch to the face snapped me out of my monologue as I hesitantly landed on the wooden floor, lifting my mask up for the “target” to not identify me. Though my conscience was as bright as day, shouting at me to stop my future actions. I knew that I couldn’t possibly hurt my father figure, Miguel–a wise man who’d always know the trick to every nook and cranny. The man who taught me what was right and what was wrong, the man who taught me how to shoot a pistol, and the man who’d held me tight every night while I went to sleep, crying about my dead family in his arms. My tracks stopped in front of a door, and I rethought my life choices.<br /><br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could this really be it? The thought of murdering the only person I had left who was close to family stopping my quest and journey to avenge my family? My fingers trembled as they reached for the doorknob, a quiet but loud march that would soon lead me to whatever-the-hell would happen to me next.<br /><br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A croak on the other side of the room urged me to finally swing the wooden object to the adjacent wall, and my ears were impacted with fringing noise. The pain was oh so great, I could already imagine myself tossing and turning my head, slamming it against the thick walls of mahogany and popping it right open then and there. But I couldn’t move. What was holding me back? The man who I once had thought was my peaceful father-to-be, who lulled me that everything was finally going to be alright. That “...things will finally be the way they were meant t’be,” He’d crack a stupid smile that the hairs of his beard would move in symphony to match the resulting shape. So this was what he had meant, I scoffed, all tension at ease at the pistol aimed at me from the opposite side of the room. “Didn’t know you’d be one to become the traitor, old man.” I mused, dipping my hip beneath my hand as I stood ever so confidently. “I’d be saying the same to you, son.” His eyes averted to the mask that now sat on my head, a gaze so melancholy it’d match the one of my mother when she saw me one last time. “Well I wouldn’t have done it if you had told me that you worked for him!” A step forward was taken, and the both of us found ourselves shouting at each other. The pistol was still raised, and rage swelled up to my brain, a violet glow refracting from the palms of my gloved hands; the air around my fists felt excruciatingly hot to the touch, similar to the temperature of molten magma. “I’m sorry, but it was for yer own good! I– I couldn’t risk breaking you like how you were back in your youngn age.” His tan strands were stuck to his forehead, small beads rolling down the sides of his face. A tsk escaped me as I noticed Miguel’s unease. He’s letting his guard down, take him! “I’m glad that worked out beautifully.” The brunette’s expression maintained stern as a violent grin made its way to my freckled face, the weapon in his hand shaking from its owner.<br /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point I was well unaware that I was lifted into the air, a leather-black wing growing from the broken joint of where my stunning periwinkle wing once hung, joining its other lively twin. The insectoid wasn’t far from where I had been levitating, witnessing the unfolding truth about the man who took me under his own wing. I laughed at the irony I came up with internally, and Miguel was taken aback by the wicked sight. This wasn’t the son he claimed to have, nor the kid he raised all those years. The son who he bragged about to almost all of our neighbors whenever I had joined him on a strange patrol that I thought to be out of the ordinary as a child. “This ‘lil feller here’s my boy, just look at ‘im! Ain’t he the cutest thing?” His parental side stood out from his overly macho look. The other people chuckled at the comment that he made about me, for they knew that he did this to annoy me. And he did, and I’d roll my eyes with a huff, stating almost every time, “Stop treating me like an infant, I’m only thirteen.” It was a broken record that I’d have on loop each time he mentioned me or even cooed at me, but nevertheless I’d find it satisfying when he gawked right back at me with a snarl or even, “C’mon son, can’t ya see I’m trying to spoil ya?” The air would be full of our laughter back then. Similar to those golden days, the air was full of laughter once more, except Miguel wasn’t joining my harmony with his melody. Nor was there even an entire choir of us to continue the symphony. Nay, I was cackling in front of the man I mistakenly called my second father, with a gun aimed at my cold black heart, and flames that I had shot at him surrounding his person. “‘He’ll still love’ me, isn’t that right, Bandit? This face full of terror say anything about love?” My black-red eyes were fixed on his own forest-ivy gape, his striped raccoon-tail tucked between his legs as if he were caught with a lie. A lie I unfortunately knew since that fateful day when I noticed a strange creature walk into the cowboy’s store.<br /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It wasn’t the usual otter or raccoon humanoid that’d always ask us to get what it needed. Sure, it had a tail similar to them including Miguel, but it was thin and almost too grotesque to even stare at; it mimicked that of a rat but had the texture of a gerbil, with fur containing a violet-indigo tint. The clothes it wore matched as well, with a darker hue of navy-purple, a bell and a stringed bow attaching the ends of the robe ever so delicately. Another matching bell also hung from the equivalent pointed hat that the figure wore, a grand amount of fur resembling hair grown from all sides of its head to even in front of its eyes–there was so much I couldn’t even tell that it had eyes or not. The two picked up a chatter as I vigilantly watched from the other corner of the store, helping out a customer to her needs. Once Miguel had caught my look, he gestured to the figure to the back of the store, the actual house part of the entire building. As they walked out, the figure looked back at me, handing me a toothy grin as it walked away with the person I held dear at that moment. I knew for a damn fact that that thing wasn’t okay in the slightest. “This was that thing’s doing, huh?” I laughed maniacally as magenta-violet flames sprouted on the palms of my hands, newly grown horns insanely glowing white as the fire cracked and whipped in the presence of the other man. With only a glint of despair, he threw a punch at me, pulling the trigger all the meanwhile. The aquatic insectoid behind me pierced a scream as he noticed the arms that had gone off, gasping as the dust revealed the pistol caught right next to my head, gripped tightly in my hand. A sickening bruise began to collect itself after the impact of the incoming fist, and I melted the gun right there in front of the traitor’s eyes, the horrific grin almost hurting as it grew for each time the man below me increased his whimpering. My hand tossed away the now melted bits of the weapon, a similar fist meeting the man’s face and other parts of his body. It was a true symphony of pain, mixed with grunts and crunches of bones being dislocated and slowly crushed in some places; smeared blood ran along my fingertips as I sank my claws into his skin, throwing some kicks and flames all the meanwhile. <br /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miguel was soon begging for mercy, a flood of crimson red surrounding him as bits and pieces of flesh were missing from his skin, bruises and several teeth missing. Burn marks bloomed across his face and body, and all I could do as a response was sneer. “Now, you’re going to tell me where this ‘gervil’ is located.” I frowned at the trembling man, lifting my flaming arm to indicate his second path if he didn’t utter a word. Revealing his true colors, Miguel spat on the ground with hatred and tears in his eyes, whiskers dusted with blood-water droplets. “You may not be my biological son, but you sure as hell ain’t acting like the boy I raised. You’re not getting an answer from me, not until the day I–” That sentence was all too familiar.<br /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hand involuntarily darted at the man’s neck, constricting down on the very bones that consist of the body area. The sound of despair and choking wasn’t new to my ears, but somehow sounded relieving knowing that I was going to end the life of the man who aided the murderer of my family. My real family. “P- Please! I’m sorry s– son, I’ll tell you where he is, just please let g- go! We can be happy ‘n all a- after!” I paused the slow clenching, a low growl emitting from beneath my regions that almost made my tone demonic. “Where.” The temperature of my palms soon began to rise as I heard the location, my anticipation not lasting after what seemed like hours for the answer to be revealed. “Katinchilas! Right at the bottom of the planet, there you’ll find hi–” A sickening crack which was followed by a soft thump was audible throughout the entire room, an ocean of red liquid and melted bone flooding the small area where I now stood.<br /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Right. Onward.” I sighed to my comrade, the both of us sliding our masks over our faces as we began marching our way back out of the city that we at last had made it to, every physical feature disappearing along the way. Before I left, I took one last look at the body of who was once my father figure, firing a rose-gold dagger right smack in the middle of the humanoid’s head, watching fresh blood drip down his tanned face after another snap was heard. All I had to stare at in pity was the soft delicate tail that was littered with specks of red, wondering as to why a magnificent creature like he had dealt with such atrocities who believed that good came to those who forcefully got what they wanted. But everyone knows that that all leads to chaos.<br /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the sunsetting sky shone down from above, I reconciled in silence as I confirmed spiritually that this is the path and road that I chose to take. This is what I must do to end the life of that tyrant, and restore peace to my once joyful country now blasted with apocalyptic rot that burns the hearts of many citizens.<br /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so it will be. Until the prophecy is complete.<br /><br />
