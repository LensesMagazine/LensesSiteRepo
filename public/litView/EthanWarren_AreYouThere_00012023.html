Her legs were on the verge of snapping from the pressure. Her brown hair was turning black from the dirt it picked up. Her blue jeans were tattered, filthy. She had been running for so long she hadn't even noticed where she was, nor did she notice where it was. Every lumbering tree and rustling bush looked the same. The forest was nothing but a maze of green, illuminated by nothing more than moonlight. Audrey wanted nothing more than to stop but she couldn’t. Her very life hung in the balance. Audrey finally began to take notice of her surroundings. Desperately searching for something to save her. The sound of its growling came into earshot. It was getting closer. Audrey ran faster. She knew she wasn’t escaping the forest. She knew she had to hide. “Would it find me in a bush?” She thought in panic. “Can I climb a tree or something?” Audrey needed a way to hide. She was still running and still hadn’t found a way out. The crunching of dead leaves and twigs under her feet. The passive wind blowing against her face. The chirping of birds and howling of wolves was flooding her ears. Tears were beginning to roll down Audrey’s cheeks. The inevitability of her fate was starting to become undeniably clear. Through the tears, Audrey saw something coming into the view on the forest path. The very right managed to calm her desperate tears. There was a clearing in the forest, within it was an old wooden shed. Rustic and worn down, it was larger and seemed spacious. It looked as if it had been there for years, but its appearance is not what mattered to Audrey. To her, it was a chance of survival. She ran towards the shed with what strength she had left. The growling sounds of what was chasing her had gone completely quiet. As she scanned her surroundings, Audrey heard no footsteps or rustling in the bushes around her. It seemed as if the entire forest had gone silent. “I lost it.” Audrey asked herself, with a glint of joy entering her body. <br />
<br>           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adrenaline in her body settled. She fell back against the door, leaning on it to take the weight of her body off her legs. Audrey’s breath grew heavy. The consequences of her constant running finally caught up to her. She wanted to collapse on the ground from exhaustion. In the void of silence, a loud crunching noise erupted into her ears. Then another. Then again and again. Each sound was louder than the last. It was the sound of footsteps, approaching Audrey’s exact location. It knew she was there. The adrenaline that had finally settled in her body quickly rose again. Her heart once again began to beat like a drum. Audrey stood straight up and turned over to open the door to the shed, but to no avail. The door was locked. The sound approaching footsteps became faster. Increasingly faster. It was running towards her. Audrey turned over her shoulder after hearing the increased pace. She nearly fainted from what she saw. It was closing in on her. She could see It down the path that she had come from. Audrey could see the red glow of its eyes. The reflective property of its pale white skin made it stand out in the dark, shadowy forest. It stood almost seven feet from the ground. Despite its humanoid appearance, It ran like a beast. Lowering close to the ground and leaning forward as to use its arms to run on all fours, like an ape. It was completely hairless, and wore no clothing. Even from a distance Audrey could see the bright blood stains covering its head and body. Audrey turned back to the door handle and continued to shake it with all her strength. The door would still not yield to her. She began to scream and shake the door, tears streaming down her face. The approaching beast was only growing closer, and she had still not made any progress. Audrey finally gave and let go of the door handle. It was then when she finally noticed a window to the right of the door. She clung to the edge of the window and started to pull it to the open. The metallic frame of the window frame was old and resistant. Audrey pulled with all her strength and then some. The window slowly creaked open. Audrey glanced back to see where It was. It was much closer than she wanted it to be. The distance between them couldn’t have been more than a mile. Audrey could make out the saliva falling from its mouth. Audrey turned back to the window and continued to pull. After about ten seconds she managed to open it up enough for her to crawl through. Audrey once again turned back, to her surprise It was much closer then she had anticipated. Every second it grew closer. A raging beat closing in on its fleeing prey. Audrey ran up to the window and attempted to climb into it. She grabbed both sides of the window frame and tried to pull herself up, placing her foot against the wall to use as leverage. When she was almost in, her foot slipped off against the wall. The sudden movement caused her to completely fall over on the ground. Audrey screamed in fear and desperation as she fell. As she quickly stood up she saw that It was now just a couple of yards away from her. Audrey then took a few steps away from the window. She braced herself and then started running towards the window. Just before she crashed into the wall she jumped, diving through the open window. Her plan had worked. She managed to make the jump, landing on the inside of the shed. Even with the adrenaline pumping through her veins, the force of her fall was too much for Audrey. She struggled to pull herself back on her feet. She wondered if she even could stand anymore. She tried to find strength, but simply couldn’t. Her body was starting to finally give in to the exhaustion. Her eyes began to close. She was staring through the open window. The sound of footsteps once again entered her ears. Audrey’s eyes open wide. Panic once again spread through her entire body. She had left the only way into the shed wide open for It to enter from. The rush of fear gave Audrey the strength to rise up from the floor. She slowly picked herself up, crawling to the window as she did, but it appeared to be too late. It extended its slim, ghostly pale arm through the window. Its fingers were stained with bright, contrasting red. Its fingernails were a dirty yellow, with dirt and grime underneath them. Each nail was two inches long and jagged at the ends. Each hand resembled the claws of an animal more than that of a human appendage. Audrey managed to bring herself to feet, but instead decided to run away rather than confront the beast. She quickly looked around the shed. There were tools, camping supplies, wooden planks, and other miscellaneous objects. She noticed a gray metallic locker in the very back of the shed. She quickly ran towards it. “Please open!” She begged internally. Once she grabbed the handle she pulled with all her might. To her surprise it opened with ease. Audrey quickly crawled into the locker and closed the door on it shut. The locker was big enough to hold her, but not enough for Audrey to be comfortable. She was cramped in the locker. She could barely move her body. It felt as if she had just stepped into her own coffin. There were a row of three slits in the door that were at the same height as her eyes. She leaned forward to look through them. <br>
<br>           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was silence. No creaking of floor boards, no cracking of twigs, not even a breath. Audrey was petrified. She couldn’t see It through the slits in the locker door. Her breath was still, but her heart was beating louder than ever before, as if it was trying to break out of her chest. She leaned closer to the slits in the locker door hoping to see where it went. “Where are you?” She thought to herself, horrified. “Where are you? Where are you? Are you there? Where are you? Are you there? Are you there?” The same question was racing through her mind. It was then when a noise finally entered the void of silence in the shed. It was a scratching noise. It sounded as if a blade was being run across a metal surface, but it wasn’t just any surface. There was something scraping against the door. Audrey’s mind went blank. The scraping sound went on for what seemed like an eternity. The ear piercing noise was digging into Audrey’s ears. Her composure was starting to break. She began to lose control of her breath. Her heart seemed to only beat faster. Suddenly, the scraping noise stopped. Almost as suddenly as it began. It was then when a low growling noise started to play. It sounded as if a wild animal was preparing to pounce on its defenseless prey. The locker was then shaken. It swayed from side to side for a moment before finally stopping. Audrey leaned away from the door of the locker and closed her eyes, in a final, desperate attempt to protect herself. That’s when it spoke. Its voice was low and hoarse. It dragged out each syllable, putting a chilling emphasis on each word.
<br>                       
<br>                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Are you there?”
<br>        
<br>           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very sound of its voice was enough to break the last of Audrey’s will. She knew it was there, and it knew she was there. Audrey then reclaimed her composure. She slowly opened her eyes, as if she was waking from a slumber. There was once again silence. No scraping on the door, no low growing, and once again no breathing. For a reason she could not understand, Audrey decided to once again lean forward and peek out the slit in the locker door. Her entire body froze once she did. Only one thing was in view. The glaring, glowing crimson red eyes, the pale hairless face, and the dried dark stains of blood on its cheeks and forehead. It was tired of waiting. It wanted its prey. She could feel its malice through the locker door. Audrey simply stared back at the monster. She knew what would come next, but she couldn’t get her body to move. Her breath remained still. Her mind was blank. She closed her eyes again, not in fear, but in acceptance. It was ready for its next feast.
