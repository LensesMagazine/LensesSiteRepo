If he stayed here for any longer, he might as well be put out like a candle. The vigilante was sure that there were quite a few warrants for his arrest, but his partner in crime didn’t mind. Bandit pipped as he carefully secured the bits and pieces of fruit that he managed to gather in his never ending bag: unlimited space to fit anything ranging from the tiniest pebbles to the largest submarine. The older male turned around at the sound of distant sirens, eyes darting everywhere. “Any time now, Larson.” he hissed, the insectoid spinning around with a huff. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Unless you don’t want to starve, don’t rush me!”<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally they escaped, rummaging through vines and broken bases of old buildings to get to their next desired destination: the prairie–peaceful at the name, yet it is known to be extremely dry and useless despite their enhanced technology. Although cars could fly, they still wished to live in what Terrans would identify as, the “Wild West,” towns scattered with saloons and wooden homes, rising to the highest skies as if they were the modern skyscrapers. They indeed had a nice color scheme to the all-familiar magenta sky of Mertia, with their flowers and dusty lamp posts. When the pair got there, they groaned at the sight of vines. It seemed that those prickly snakes were a common theme on Mertia.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“And you’re sure that this guy.. What’s his name? Western dude with the orange streak in his hair?” Bandit brushed his rose tufts out of his eyes, coughing a bit from the dust as he stared at Ray with the utmost curiosity. A scoff was heard, and the insectoid started apologizing instantly when the other took off the mask that he wore to protect himself from his hated asthma. “He’s a junker, goes by the name Bubbly. Though it doesn’t really fit his personality anymore.” Bandit blinked as he observed the black-and-white image, processing the information. “How come? You met him?” The photo was snatched from his anxious paws, “He used to be this great guy. Next thing you know, y’call him ‘Dad’ by accident. Spoke about his life, mentioned a few raccoons he kept as a kid–guy’s obsessed with them. I went back to visit him once, he barely spoke. ‘Over there’ and ‘in the back’, was his normal dialogue.”<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They walked in silence afterwards, Bandit giving his partner a couple of worried glances as the other reminisced in grief. He used to have a better life than his broken one from the start, why had Miguel changed at that instance? Mahogany doors met his eyes as Ray came to a stop, and he couldn’t help but feel a tug in his gut that made him rethink his choices. But he just needed to know. A loud creak was heard as he let himself in, the doors swinging shut behind him after his partner followed. The vigilante walked through his teenage abode, ignoring the tug on his jacket; there was an unusually hard cough in the small office near the corridor. Raymond mimicked the same sound, breathing heavily as he made way to the back of the shop, particles engulfing his lungs, and his partner had noticed although he kept his mouth shut. His mask, the poor boy screamed in his head. But he wasn’t the only one that had a horrific reaction.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His one true father-like guardian lay on the ground with several bullet wounds, pasty green blood splattered as far as the eye could see. Ray’s lips quivered while inaudible sobs spilled out of him, holding the beloved dying body of the junker. He had been right all along: his familial murderer hired Bubbly to capture the vigilante at such a young age, but nevertheless he stood his ground and let him go, for he wouldn’t want that for a boy who he adored so greatly. And thus it led him to his sacrifice, the very one he knew when he saw that wicked grin at his doorstep. As for Raymond, he was met with the all-too familiar black, an audible thud soon after.<br />
