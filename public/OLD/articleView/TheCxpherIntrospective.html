                  <h1 class="questionHeader">CXPHER on his work</h1>
                  <br />
                  <h3 class="questionText">Could you elaborate on your favorite piece?</h3>
                  <p class="answerText">My favorite piece is the poem called “Killed Off.” It is one of my most personal pieces where I get to be the most honest about myself. Most of my other poems are about my relationships with other people or telling a story. Although “Killed Off” does touch on how I’m closed off from others, I’m focusing more on my own perspective and self reflection. I also think that “Killed Off” incorporates all the different things that I’ve gathered to create and perfect my writing style. It has the set up of a scene that someone can envision with the mentions of a locked, metal door and mysterious, hidden reflections. It uses my repetition of words from the previous line into the current lines when I wrote the second stanza. Most of all, this poem uses a lot of wordplay in lines like “My designated hitman, but I can take the hit, man,” or “My eyes bloodshot, from the blood that shot out of you.” I love the composition of this piece and being able to see how far my writing style has come; I’m able to see all the elements of my style put together.</p>
                  
                  <h3 class="questionText">I see you submitted two versions of stained glass, what makes them different?, or what made you want to write a second version?</h3>
                  <p class="answerText">The two versions of “Stained Glass” are connected. The poem titles themselves, “Stained Glass…” “...Turned to a Shard,”can be read as a complete sentence: “Stained glass turned to a shard.” “Stained Glass…” shows a person I’m close to and my relationship with them in a more positive light with me describing them as something colorful, made of “your colors” like stained glass. The third stanza explains that, like glass, they have sharp edges that may or may not cut me; this person has their own flaws and problems that could potentially hurt me. Yet, I’m okay with bleeding out and having it seep into their colors, metaphor for becoming one with this person, or not being cut at all and just tracing their shapes, metaphor for admiring them. I put this all together in the last paragraph when I remind them of how worthy they are. Someone as worthy and beautiful as stained glass. The second poem, “...Turned to a Shard,” mainly highlights the more negative side of my relationship with this person. I write about how they “turned to shards,” in other words, they went through something that broke or hurt them. In turn, they end up hurting me the way a piece (or shard) of glass would. I emphasize how they’re hurting me in “pretty ways” because they’re not a piece of regular glass, they’re a piece of stained glass; a glass so pretty and worthy. Instead of saying that they are worthy because they’re like stained glass, as is my main message of the first poem, I’m saying that because they are a piece of stained glass, a broken part of them that still has the properties of stained glass, I hold a soft spot for them, even when they’re hurting me. They’re worth the pain.</p>
                  
                  <h3 class="questionText">Is there a consistent theme that you repeat in your artwork? Why did you choose this theme?</h3>
                  <p class="answerText">Most of my works have a theme of color, story telling, or a combination of both. Poems like “Stained Glass…” “...Turned to a Shard” have the theme of color. “Killed Off” and “Red Haze” combine the themes of color and storytelling. Some works I have pending to upload exclusively tell a story. I chose the theme of color because I associate colors to a lot of different things. If I analyze or look at an experience, a person, or hear music for long enough I start to think of colors that reflect them. Colors help convey a lot of emotion so it’s an easy theme to build off of for my works. I also chose the storytelling theme because it lets me put an experience together on paper. Not all my works have metaphors or colors to build off of so just writing something like a short story that still has the poetic style to it is another theme that’s easy for me to build off of.</p>
                  
                  <h3 class="questionText"> What is your biggest motive or inspiration for your writing?</h3>
                  <p class="answerText">My biggest motive in writing is to create a story or to reach personal closure on different aspects of my life. Writing for me is an outlet. My inspiration for writing is either an experience I want to work towards moving past while also remembering it or people in my life and my relationship with them.</p>
                  
                  <h3 class="questionText">Do you think that any events in your life influenced your writing in any way? How do you think your art would be different if this did not happen?</h3>
                  <p class="answerText">Many events in my life end up inspiring most of my writing. I write a lot based on my experiences. If these events didn’t happen, I don’t think I would feel as connected to my writing or enjoy doing it as much as I do now.</p>
                  
                   <h3 class="questionText">You often dive into themes of desire as seen in red haze or arguably stained glass; do you consider desire to be a vice or a virtue?</h3>
                   <p class="answerText">I consider desire to be a vice. Especially in my writing, I see desire as bitter-sweet. I think desire can be something that at times is good, but overall it can become so all-consuming that it brings a lot of destruction.</p>
                  
                  <h3 class="questionText">What audience do you try to speak to with your poetry?</h3>
                  <p class="answerText">I try to speak to myself. At times I can have all these thoughts about a certain person or experience, that I write a poem out of it to move past my overthinking. My main audience is myself since writing is my outlet, but my audience can also be people who have similar experiences to mine. In a general sense, even if someone doesn’t relate to my poetry, my audience could be anyone who likes to see a story play out in the shortened versions of sentences in poems known as lines. Anyone who likes connecting an experience or someone to a metaphor, and seeing that written out in a way that anyone can understand.</p>
                  
                  
                  <h3 class="questionText">Have you considered the visual arts as a different way of diving into the themes you’re interested in?</h3>
                  <p class="answerText">I have considered it. I use a lot of imagery and colors in my poems that I’m able to visualize the scene or story. I’ve thought about moving that onto paper through visual arts, whether through a small sketch or a detailed one that relates to the poem. For example, when I wrote my “Stained Glass…” poem, I considered drawing the person I wrote it about in the style traditionally used in stained glass I see in real life. In art that I’ve done in the past, I’ve done themes of very grunge and monochromatic themes with a pop of color. Something that is found in poems like “Red Haze” and “Killed Off.”</p>

                  <h1 class="questionHeader">CXPHER on his life</h1>
                  <br />
                  <h3 class="questionText">Why did you choose the name cxpher?, is there any underlying meaning?</h3>
                  <p class="answerText">Most of my work has a double meaning to it or has extended metaphors in it. My work needs some “deciphering” to fully uncover its meaning, the same way a cipher needs it. I went with the name “CXPHER” because of this and changed the “i” to an “x” out of matching an edgy, darker theme like the one found in my writing.</p>
                  
                  <h3 class="questionText">What type of literature do you often delve into, give some examples?</h3>
                  <p class="answerText">Type of literature that I delve into is young adult fiction and drama like “The Outsiders” by S.E Hinton and “We are Lost and Found” by Helene Dunbar, which also involves romance. I also like poetry books with themes of internal struggle and romance and heartbreak like the “Pillow Thoughts” series by Courtney Peppernell. </p>
                  
                  <h3 class="questionText">What media do you think influenced your writing/music the most?</h3>
                  <p class="answerText">Books that I read really shaped my writing. “Pillow Thoughts” and “The Outsiders” had the most influence on my writing, outside of my own experiences. Electronic and alternative pop/rock music also influenced my writing, but also the type of music I want to create and work on.</p>
                  
                  <h3 class="questionText">Do you think a writer has to cross a threshold for their pieces to be considered a bit more serious or prominent than their other pieces (do you think there's a stage in a writer's life that only serves to hone in basic writing skills)?</h3>
                  <p class="answerText">I believe that writing is an ever growing process. How serious a piece seems is very objective. I think when someone is first starting out in their writing, they start to hone in the basic skills of writing. This happens in the beginning, but as you carry on, I know for me this happened, you start to branch out and away from that beginning stage. However, crossing this threshold doesn’t really make a piece seem more serious. The piece has simply evolved from the previous one.</p>
                  
                  
                  <h3 class="questionText">You often dive into themes of men’s health; whyso?</h3>
                  <p class="answerText">Writing, as I’ve said, is an outlet for me. Society hasn’t entirely normalized men and their vulnerability. Writing lets me be vulnerable as a person, but also as a man. Men’s health is a theme I touch upon since most guys don’t feel comfortable doing that out of not being socially accepted to do so. If other men aren’t going to do it, I’ll take my chances and do it through my writing, my outlet.</p>
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  <h1 class="questionHeader">CXPHER on music</h1>
                  <br />
                  <h3 class="questionText">Do you think the musical landscape is stagnant?, why?</h3>
                  <p class="answerText"> I think the musical landscape is stagnant. Everyone is kind of reusing the same patterns and styles, as most do since all art is recycled.</p>
                  
                  <h3 class="questionText">You produced a very serene and calm song (the first on the digital magazine), do you plan on expanding to a style of music that includes some form of singing or an array of different instruments?</h3>
                  <p class="answerText">I do want to expand on my style of music, since I’m just starting out. I will still keep the keyboard/piano because it’s an easier instrument for me to play and write music on. I’m considering adding slight vocals in the future and electronic beats as well.</p> 
                  
                  <h3 class="questionText">What audience do you primarily target with your music if there is any?</h3>
                  <p class="answerText">I don't really target anyone in my music, at least for now. Maybe if I start adding different instrumentation and vocals into future music pieces my audience could change. As of now, I’m my own target audience.</p>
