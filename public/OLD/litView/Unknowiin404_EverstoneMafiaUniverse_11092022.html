                <p class="u-text u-text-body-alt-color u-text-6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city seemed to be at rest with its lullabies of car engines and hypotonic sirens that roamed the streets. For Raymond and his gang, it wasn’t just as so. “How much longer?” The wary Jubilee had asked, anxious since the beginning of their tedious plan—to stop a famous monopoly, one that had cost the life of all their families; to Ray, that included his best friend. Kidnapped at eight, he claimed once. But that was all. “Until there’s no more of that.” The strawberry blonde nodded his head at the sudden wail of another siren, as on cue. Bandit had begun to pace around the room now, semi-confident in their plan. In the background, Raymond and Jubilee cooked up a discussion on how they’ll burst into the headquarters, but Bandit was worried that his time was almost up. There’ll have to be a temporary hiatus for him to be injected with the only medicine available to him that will just save his life from his perilous disease until the next time he’d have to do it; a mere century at that.<br /><br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Will you two stop bickering for once and focus?” His magenta curls bounced in place as he slammed his hands on the table, causing the squabbling pair to settle down. “It’s almost time for me to do the you-know-what, so can we please just go there already and at least do something right?” Bandit let out a sigh of distress as he shuffled to his corner of the room, digging his head between his knees. It hasn’t been the same since these poor souls each lost their relatives and friends at the hand of the group, Quintessentialis, enraged and never to forgive them. Their leader was a madman: a tyrant who’d stop at nothing to achieve full power and riches, capturing many towns under the government’s nose. Ray recalled seeing the man himself; a person no less than their own age, disguised as a lamb, an innocent teenager like them.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A figure swung into their own headquarters from the window, and you’d think that they’d flinch, ready to put up a fight to defend their own hide in fear. But alas, it was their spy, Keith, a boy who knew Quintessentialis’ lair  like the back of his hand. Bandit however, fulfilled your expectations. “You sound like a girl!” Keith cackled, receiving a blow on his shoulder from the astounded man. “Anything, Tyker?” Ray stepped forward, greeting the man with a pat on his arm. A sudden touch was enough for him to have a bit of red on his cheeks, Keith hiding the emotion deep down from him and the others. The ravenette pursed his lips, putting all of his weight on his hip as he thought with a finger at his chin. “Hm, maybe—they’ve had their guard down the entire time! What took you guys so long, I thought you had the best hacker here!” He cried, turning his gaze to Jubilee, who had her hands raised in surrender.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Nobody told me what to do! I was expecting some sort of, ‘oh you’re good to go’! Not, ‘Jubilee, can you stop worrying?’, ‘Jubilee, why are you so anxious about the plan?’, ‘Jubilee, can you make me a gosh darn sandwich’?!” The blonde groaned, stomping her heel at the ground after a few awkward minutes before turning around and performing a quick ritual on her computer. “Oh wow it’s all clear, we can go now.” She rolled her eyes after the men cheered as if nothing had occurred, gathering their materials before they headed out.<br /><br />

                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They crawled through an air system, Keith trotting through the hallways as if he owned the entire building. He’d whisper every action that the machine would do, ranging from a board meeting to a guard’s crass conversation on their cell phone. Bandit would roll his eyes at each remark that the spy would give them, Raymond snuffling a few soft chuckles of his own. Everything had been going smoothly, and the eldest of the three couldn’t be more happy to finally gain peace. That was, until Jubilee started squawking into the communicator. Ray frowned, shaking his head. “Jubilee, do we have to do this agai—“ But the girl couldn’t calm herself down. “WHATDDOYA MEAN YOU’RE CAPTURED?!” They all froze, Bandit bumping into the strawberry blonde’s rear end, to which he loudly let out a shout of shock, along with a huge fit of scolding earned from Raymond. Once he quieted down, he leaned next to the blonde, listening closely to the communicator. “YOU GUYS NEED TO GET OUT RIGHT NOW, THEY’RE COMING FOR ME, SAVE YOURSEL—“ The device spat out white noise.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All three teenagers looked at each other in fear as to what’s going to become of them now, but nevertheless Raymond carried on. He’ll gladly take the risk, such as was known ever since he was a kid. His heterochromatic eyes shone in the dark as he sped past the two flailing shadows who called for him to fall back. But the boy was relentless; he will do anything to get back at the man who took his mother’s life. Especially his mother. That woman did not need to die in vain, she had no right to take her own life for his own to flourish—rather, he would’ve killed himself instead to go with her into the afterlife.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man suddenly fell through the air-duct hatch after his inner monologue had simmered down. He groaned as ringing echoed through his ears, the ice-like floor mocking him as his quaking body tried to reconstruct itself from the floor. Heels clicked amongst the vast room, an eerie chuckle taunting him to get up and strike at the very being that dared him to kill it. “Had any fun yet, little boy?” Raymond dug his nails into the ground at the sound of the piercing voice. “Oh, you remember me! How sweet!” The figure chirped, ferociously yanking the man by the thick tufts of his hair. He hissed, swiping at the source of the voice. “Now, we wouldn’t want you to waste your energy on ‘lil ‘ol me. Settle down, have some tea and relax! You’ve truly outworked yourself.. if I had to be honest, I’d say you were trying to kill me, is that right? Ramon?” Using the energy stored in his calf, he kicked at the figure, unaware that his heel landed directly on the voice’s jaw, distorting it. The strawberry blonde smiled at the new symphony of coughs and grunts. “That’s Raymond Oxford to ya, you bastard.”<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silence substituted the voice, mixed with dust particles in the faded room. Focused on his surroundings, the aroma was similar to that of rotting blood. He’d recognize that scent anywhere. “Oxford?” The voice croaked, panting like a fierce carnivore. “That’s strange.. I thought there were no more of you …well! Turns out I was wrong!” The tyrant finally revealed himself in what was made of the only light source in the room. His split hair ends were covered in speckles of dry blood, hidden by his gorgeous scarlet-cyan hair threads. A smile consisting of teeth with a wide gap smack in the middle made up the entirety of his ghostly face, a set of vibrant emerald eyes sitting right above that painstaking grin. “Go to hell.” Raymond snarled, gaze focused on the reddened bruise forming on his right cheek. “Why go to it when I’m already living in it?” His smile widened, and already the heroine had forgotten about his crew stuck deep in god knows where. A glimmer of hope sensed that they were probably on their way to find him—or they’re just being idiots in the vents. “Y’see Raymond, controlling several towns at a time is much easier than having to pay all of those silly things miscreants call ‘taxes’, and I could easily get rid of poverty if I gained more control than just simple towns! It all comes down to business, really.”<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You’re a murderer! You’ve slaughtered millions!” He spat, watching the sly expression of the other change to one of utter disgust. “Has your mother taught you any manners when she was alive still? Do you know it’s rude to interrupt people when they’re talking? That’s what Momma taught me, and she didn’t die like some idiot. Oh, I’m sorry, I meant to say uh.. ‘savior’?” His target grin returned to its spot, and all Ray wanted to do was to scream, kick something, kill him. Anything. He’s already done so much so far, and his conscience cannot stop him now like how it always would. The voices can’t infiltrate his head anymore, nor can the screams of his victims. The tyrant continued to target his weak spots, bellowing here and there, but Raymond at the meanwhile had encountered a loose point with the object that he was chained with, detangling it with the hand that was available to his desire.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the heroine had been freed from the restraints, he threw himself onto the beckoning sneerer, bashing his fists and the heavy metal lagger that held him back earlier against the split-haired man’s face and body. The shouts that filled the room fueled up the rage that Raymond had bottled up all those years. Was this the power that this so-called millionaire was looking for all along? Why did it feel so good? After his hands were stained with the all-knowing crimson liquid from before, he kneeled at the motionless puppet, weeping.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His mother can finally rest.<br />
