<br />
<br />It was 10 P.M. on a cold night. Which wasn’t too strange with the current weather. A single man was walking across the sidewalk in the seemingly desolate city block. He had hazelnut brown eyes with straight jet black hair that went down to his shoulders. He wore a dark office attire. A dark gray suit with a navy tie. The man stood 5 feet and 111 inches from the ground, and was 23 years old. Thomas was working late that night and decided to walk home. He couldn’t help but shake a feeling of anxiety. He felt very nervous being out this late all alone. Thomas checked his phone after an audible ring was heard. It was a text from his close friend, Marcus. Something about his new girlfriend Mary.
<br />
<br />           “Congrats man, but why text me this now?” Thomas said out loud. He felt no need to speak to himself when he was alone in the street.
<br />
<br />Thomas was walking past multiple alleyways. They were filled with tents and sleeping bags, the homeless had to sleep somewhere. Thomas truthfully thought little of them. While he understood that they’re misfortune wasn’t their own doing, he didn’t feel much sympathy. He simply chose to focus on his own life, with little thought for others. It considered it the reasonable way to live life.
<br />
<br />“Spare change?” A decrepit voice asked from an alley. It was a homeless beggar. He was holding a plastic cup up to Thomas.
<br />
<br />“Sorry sir, I have nothing on me.” Thomas said knowing full well how much money he was carrying.
<br />
<br /> Thomas thought that the man would just use it to buy drugs or something of the sort. “Why should I give him my money?” Thomas asked himself. He was just a block away from his apartment complex when he heard a loud screech. He thought nothing of it at first. “Probably someone messing around in an alley.  That seems to happen a lot here.” Thomas thought to himself. As he made his way to a crosswalk, he heard another loud noise. Thomas once again ignored the loud sound, glancing down at his watch, all he could think about was how much he wanted to lay down in his bed and drift into sleep. Thomas was walking down the crosswalk as a bright light started to fill his field of view. Whether it was fatigue or ignorance, Thomas once more ignored what his senses were detecting. Finally, he came to the realization of his surroundings. And then, it hit him. It was a car. 
<br />
<br />                                         ***
<br />
<br />Thomas woke up with blurred vision and a massive pain in his head. He was lying in the middle of the road. He was immediately bombarded with lurid sights and ringing in his ears. There were loud noises all around him. Sounds of sirens and people yelling.
<br />
<br /> 	“He’s awake!” A man nearby Thomas screamed. It was a paramedic. 
<br />
<br />“Sir, can you hear me?” The paramedic asked very concernedly, crouching down next to Thomas.
<br />
<br />“What? What happened?” Thomas asked, still coming to his senses. 
<br />
<br />“You were in a hit and run. Sir, do you feel alright?”
<br />
<br />“What the hell do you mean? I was hit by a damn car? Just let me get up and…” 
<br />
<br />Thomas tried to get up, but hesitated. He couldn’t find the strength to move his legs. His vision finally went straight, and he saw the most horrific sight before him. His body was completely mangled. The bones in his legs were shattered and even protruding from within. His suit was tattered, revealing gashes and bruises all over his body. A deep cut spanned across his forehead. It was bleeding profusely, causing blood to seep into his eyes and mouth. Thomas almost fell back into unconsciousness. 
<br />
<br />“What the hell? How is that…Why am I... What is happening?” Thomas muttered in confusion.
<br />
<br /> Despite being terribly maimed, he was wide awake and feeling no pain. 
<br />
<br />“Sir I…” The paramedic seemed just as confused. “Get a gourney! We need to take him to a hospital now!” He yelled to the surrounding paramedics.
<br />
<br /> “What is happening? Am I going to die?” Thomas screamed out.
<br />
<br />“You’ll get your answers soon Thomas. I promise it will all make sense in time.” Thomas heard a voice whisper. It sounded as if it was just beside him. The voice was deep and ghastly.
<br />
<br />Thomas heard the voice but saw nobody around that could have said it. “Who was that? Am I hallucinating? Is this real? What was that voice? How am I still alive?” He thought to himself. His mind was racing with questions, and there seemed to be no answers. For now.
